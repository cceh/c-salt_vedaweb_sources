   "01.032.09": "Then humbled was the strength of Vrtra's mother: Indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her. The mother was above, the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay Danu.",
   "01.032.10": "Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward. The waters bear off Vrtra's nameless body: the foe of Indra sank to during darkness.",
   "01.032.11": "Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of Dasas, the waters stayed like kine held by the robber. But he, when he had smitten Vrtra, opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned.",
   "01.032.12": "A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God without a second, Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers.",
   "01.032.13": "Nothing availed him lightning, nothing thunder, hailstorm or mist which had spread around him: When Indra and the Dragon strove in battle, Maghavan gained the victory for ever.",
   "01.032.14": "Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him; That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst nine-and-ninety flowing rivers?",
   "01.032.15": "Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and horned, the Thunder-wielder. Over all living men he rules as Sovran, containing all as spokes within the felly.",
   "01.033.01": "Come, fain for booty let us seek to Indra: yet more shall he increase his care that guides us. Will not the Indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this wealth, of cattle?",
   "01.033.02": "I fly to him invisible Wealth-giver as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie, With fairest hymns of praise adoring Indra, whom those who laud him must invoke in battle.",
   "01.033.03": "Mid all his host, he bindeth on the quiver he driveth cattle from what foe he pleaseth: Gathering up great store of riches, Indra. be thou no trafficker with us, most mighty.",
   "01.033.04": "Thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy Dasyu, alone, yet going with thy helpers, Indra! Far from the floor of heaven in all directions, the ancient riteless ones fled to destruction.",
   "01.033.05": "Fighting with pious worshippers, the riteless turned and fled, Indra! with averted faces. When thou, fierce Lord of the Bay Steeds, the Stayer, blewest from earth and heaven and sky the godless.",
   "01.033.06": "They met in fight the army of the blameless. then the Navagvas put forth all their power. They, like emasculates with men contending, fled, conscious, by steep paths from Indra, scattered.",
   "01.033.07": "Whether they weep or laugh, thou hast o'erthrown them, O Indra, on the sky's extremest limit. The Dasyu thou hast burned from heaven, and welcomed the prayer of him who pours the juice and lauds thee.",
   "01.033.08": "Adorned with their array of gold and jewels, they o'er the earth a covering veil extended. Although they hastened, they o'ercame not Indra: their spies he compassed with the Sun of morning.",
   "01.033.09": "As thou enjoyest heaven and earth, O Indra, on every side surrounded with thy greatness, So thou with priests bast blown away the Dasyu, and those who worship not with those who worship.",
   "01.033.10": "They who pervaded earth's extremest limit subdued not with their charms the Wealth-bestower: Indra, the Bull, made his ally the thunder, and with its light milked cows from out the darkness.",
   "01.033.11": "The waters flowed according to their nature; he raid the navigable streams waxed mighty. Then Indra, with his spirit concentrated, smote him for ever with his strongest weapon.",
   "01.033.12": "Indra broke through Ilibisa's strong castles, and Suspa with his horn he cut to pieces: Thou, Maghavan, for all his might and swiftness, slewest thy fighting foeman with thy thunder",
   "01.033.13": "Fierce on his enemies fell Indra's weapon: with. his sharp bull he rent their forts in pieces. He with his thunderbolt dealt blows on Vrtra; and conquered, executing all his purpose.",
   "01.033.14": "Indra, thou helpest Kutsa whom thou lovedst, and guardedst brave Dagadyu when he battled, The dust of trampling horses rose to heaven, and Svitri's son stood up again for conquest.",
   "01.033.15": "Svitra's mild steer, O Maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land, mid Tugra's houses. Long stood they there before the task was ended: thou wast the master of the foemen's treasure.",
   "01.034.01": "Ye who observe this day be with us even thrice: far-stretching is you bounty, Asvins and your course. To you, as to a cloak in winter, we cleave close: you are to be drawn nigh unto us by the wise.",
   "01.034.02": "Three are the fellies in your honey-bearing car, that travels after Soma's loved one, as all know. Three are the pillars set upon it for support: thrice journey ye by night, O Asvins, thrice by day.",
   "01.034.03": "Thrice in the self-same day, ye Gods who banish want, sprinkle ye thrice to-day our sacrifice with meath; And thrice vouchsafe us store of food with plenteous strength, at evening, O ye Asvins, and at break of day.",
   "01.034.04": "Thrice come ye to our home, thrice to the righteous folk, thrice triply aid the man who well deserves your help. Thrice, O ye Asvins, bring us what shall make us glad; thrice send us store of food as nevermore to fail.",
   "01.034.05": "Thrice, O ye Asvins, bring to us abundant wealth: thrice in the Gods' assembly, thrice assist our thoughts. Thrice, grant ye us prosperity, thrice grant us fame; for the Sun's daughter hath mounted your threewheeled car.",
   "01.034.06": "Thrice, Asvins, grant to us the heavenly medicines, thrice those of earth and thrice those that the waters hold, Favour and health and strength bestow upon my son; triple protection, Lords of Splendour, grant to him.",
   "01.034.07": "Thrice are ye to be worshipped day by day by us: thrice, O ye Asvins, ye travel around the earth. Car-borne from far away, O ye Nasatyas, come, like vital air to bodies, come ye to the three.",
   "01.034.08": "Thrice, O ye Asvins, with the Seven Mother Streams; three are the jars, the triple offering is prepared. Three are the worlds, and moving on above the sky ye guard the firm-set vault of heaven through days and nights.",
   "01.034.09": "Where are the three wheels of your triple chariot, where are the three seats thereto firmly fastened? When will ye yoke the mighty ass that draws it, to bring you to our sacrifice. Nasatyas?",
   "01.034.10": "Nasatyas, come: the sacred gift is offered up; drink the sweet juice with lips that know the sweetness well. Savitar sends, before the dawn of day, your car, fraught with oil, various-coloured, to our sacrifice.",
   "01.034.11": "Come, O Nasatyas, with the thrice-eleven Gods; come, O ye Asvins, to the drinking of the meath. Make long our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off our enemies; be with us evermore.",
   "01.034.12": "Borne in your triple car, O Asvins, bring us present prosperity with noble offspring. I cry to you who hear me for protection be ye our helpers where men win the booty.",
   "01.035.01": "AGNI I first invoke for our prosperity; I call on Mitra, Varuna, to aid us here. I call on Night who gives rest to all moving life; I call on Savitar the God to lend us help.",
   "01.035.02": "Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest the immortal and the mortal, Borne in his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God who looks on every creature.",
   "01.035.03": "The God moves by the upward path, the downward; with two bright Bays, adorable, he journeys. Savitar comes, the God from the far distance, and chases from us all distress and sorrow.",
   "01.035.04": "His chariot decked with pearl, of various colours, lofty, with golden pole, the God hath mounted, The many-rayed One, Savitar the holy, bound, bearing power and might, for darksome regions.",
   "01.035.05": "Drawing the gold-yoked car his Bays, white-footed, have manifested light to all the peoples. Held in the lap of Savitar, divine One, all men, all beings have their place for ever.",
   "01.035.06": "Three heavens there are; two Savitar's, adjacent: in Yama's world is one, the home of heroes, As on a linch-pin, firm, rest things immortal: he who hath known it let him here declare it.",
   "01.035.07": "He, strong of wing, hath lightened up the regions, deep-quivering Asura, the gentle Leader. Where now is Surya, where is one to tell us to what celestial sphere his ray hath wandered?",
   "01.035.08": "The earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three desert regions and the Seven Rivers. God Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice treasures unto him who worships.",
   "01.035.09": "The golden-handed Savitar, far-seeing, goes on his way between the earth and heaven, Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads the bright sky through the darksome region.",
   "01.035.10": "May he, gold-handed Asura, kind Leader, come hither to us with his help and favour. Driving off Raksasas and Yatudhanas, the God is present, praised in hymns at evening.",
   "01.035.11": "O Savitar, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established in the air's midregion: O God, come by those paths so fair to travel, preserve thou us from harm this day, and bless us.",
   "01.036.01": "WITH words sent forth in holy hymns, Agni we supplicate, the Lord Of many families who duly serve the Gods, yea, him whom others also praise.",
   "01.036.02": "Men have won Agni, him who makes their strength abound: we, with oblations, worship thee. Our gracious-minded Helper in our deeds of might, be thou, O Excellent, this day.",

   "01.039.02": "Strong let your weapons be to drive away your foes, firm for resistance let them be. Yea, passing glorious must be your warrior might, not as a guileful mortal's strength.",
   "01.039.03": "When what is strong ye overthrow, and whirl about each ponderous thing, Heroes, your course is through the forest trees of earth, and through the fissures of the rocks.",
   "01.039.04": "Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the earth: Ye Rudras, may the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid defiance even now.",
   "01.039.05": "They make the mountains rock and reel, they rend the forest-kings apart. onward, ye Maruts, drive, like creatures drunk with wine, ye, Gods with all your company.",
   "01.039.06": "Ye to your chariot have yoked the spotted deer: a red deer, as a leader, draws. Even the Earth herself listened as ye came near, and men were sorely terrified.",
   "01.039.07": "O Rudras, quickly we desire your succour for this work of ours. Come to us with your aid as in the days of old, so now for frightened Kanva's sake.",
   "01.039.08": "Should any monstrous foe, O Maruts, sent by you or sent by mortals threaten us, Tear ye him from us with your power and with your might, and with the succours that are yours.",
   "01.039.09": "For ye, the worshipful and wise, have guarded Kanva perfectly. O Maruts, come to us with full protecting help, as lightning flashes seek the rain.",
   "01.039.10": "Whole strength have ye, O Bounteous Ones; perfect, earth-shakers, is your might. Maruts, against the poet's wrathful enemy send ye an enemy like a dart.",
   "01.040.01": "O BRAMANASPATI, stand up: God-serving men we pray to thee. May they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra, most swift, be thou with them.",
   "01.040.02": "O Son of Strength, each mortal calls to thee for aid when spoil of battle waits for him. O Maruts, may this man who loves you well obtain wealth of good steeds and hero might.",
   "01.040.03": "May Brahmanaspati draw nigh, may Sunrta the Goddess come, And Gods bring to this rite which gives the five-fold gift the Hero, lover of mankind.",

   "01.051.02": "As aids the skilful Rbhus yearned to Indra strong to save, who fills mid-air, encompassed round with might, Rushing in rapture; and -o'er Satakratu came the gladdening shout that urged him on to victory.",
   "01.051.03": "Thou hast disclosed the kine's stall for the Angirases, and made a way for Atri by a hundred doors. On Vimada thou hast bestowed both food and wealth, making thy bolt dance in the sacrificer's fight.",
   "01.051.04": "Thou hast unclosed the prisons of the waters; thou hast in the mountain seized the treasure rich in gifts. When thou hadst slain with might the dragon Vrtra, thou, Indra, didst raise the Sun in heaven for all to see.",
   "01.051.05": "With wondrous might thou blewest enchanter fiends away, with powers celestial those who called on thee in jest. Thou, hero-hearted, hast broken down Pipru's forts, and helped Rjisvan when the Dasyus were struck dead.",
   "01.051.06": "Thou savedst Kutsa when Susna was smitten down; to Atithigva gavest Sambara for a prey. E'en mighty Arbuda thou troddest under foot: thou from of old wast born to strike the Dasyus dead.",
   "01.051.07": "All power and might is closely gathered up in thee; thy bounteous spirit joys in drinking Soma juice. Known is the thunderbolt that lies within thine arms: rend off therewith all manly prowess of our foe.",
   "01.051.08": "Discern thou well Aryas and Dasyus; punishing the lawless give them up to him whose grass is strewn. Be thou the sacrificer's strong encourager all these thy deeds are my delight at festivals.",
   "01.051.09": "Indra gives up the lawless to the pious man, destroying by the Strong Ones those who have no strength. Vamra when glorified destroyed the gathered piles of the still waxing great one who would reach the heaven.",
   "01.051.10": "The might which Usana hath formed for thee with might rends in its greatness and with strength both worlds apart. O Hero-souled, the steeds of Vata, yoked by thought, have carried thee to fame while thou art filled with power.",
   "01.051.11": "When Indra hath rejoiced with Kavya Usana, he mounts his steeds who swerve wider and wider yet. The Strong hath loosed his bolt with the swift rush of rain, and he hath rent in pieces Susna's firmbuilt forts.",
   "01.051.12": "Thou mountest on thy car amid strong Soma draughts: Saryata brought thee those in which thou hast delight. Indra, when thou art pleased with men whose Soma flows thou risest to unchallenged glory in the sky.",
   "01.051.13": "To old Kaksivin, Soma-presser, skilled in song, O Indra, thou didst give the youthful Vrcaya. Thou, very wise, wast Mena, Vrsanaiva's child: those deeds of thine must all be told at Soma feasts.",
   "01.051.14": "The good man's refuge in his need is Indra, firm as a doorpost, praised among the Pajras. Indra alone is Lord of wealth, the Giver, lover of riches, chariots, kine, and horses.",
   "01.051.15": "To him the Mighty One, the self-resplendent, verily strong and great, this praise is uttered. May we and all the heroes, with the princes, be, in this fray, O Indra, in thy keeping.",
   "01.052.01": "I GLORIFY that Ram who finds the light of heaven, whose hundred nobly-natured ones go forth with him. With hymns may I turn hither Indra to mine aid,-the Car which like a strong steed hasteth to the call.",
   "01.052.02": "Like as a mountain on firm basis, unremoved, he, thousandfold protector, waxed in mighty strength, When Indra, joying in the draughts of Soma juice, forced the clouds, slaying Vrtra stayer of their flow.",
   "01.052.03": "For he stays e'en the stayers, spread o'er laden cloud, rooted in light, strengthened in rapture by the wise. Indra with thought, with skilled activity, I call, most liberal giver, for he sates him with the juice.",
   "01.052.04": "Whom those that flow in heaven on sacred grass, his own assistants, nobly-natured, fill full like the sea,- Beside that Indra when he smote down Vrtra stood his helpers, straight in form, mighty, invincible.",
   "01.052.05": "To him, as in wild joy he fought with him who stayed the rain, his helpers sped like swift streams down a slope, When Indra, thunder-armed, made bold by Soma draughts, as Trta cleaveth Vala's fences, cleft him through.",
   "01.052.06": "Splendour encompassed thee, forth shone thy warrior might: the rain-obstructer lay in mid-air's lowest deep, What time, O Indra, thou didst cast thy thunder down upon the jaws of Vritra hard to be restrained.",
   "01.052.07": "The hymns which magnify thee, Indra, reach to thee even as water-brooks flow down and fill the lake. Tvastar gave yet more force to thine appropriate strength, and forged thy thunderbolt of overpowering might.",
   "01.052.08": "When, Indra, thou whose power is linked with thy Bay Steeds hadst smitten Vrtra, causing floods to flow for man, Thou heldst in thine arms the metal thunderbolt, and settest in the heaven the Sun for all to see.",
   "01.052.09": "In fear they raised the lofty self-resplendent hymn, praise giving and effectual, leading up to heaven, When Indra's helpers fighting for the good of men, the Maruts, faithful to mankind, joyed in the light.",
   "01.052.10": "Then Heaven himself, the mighty, at that Dragon's roar reeled back in terror when, Indra, thy thunderbolt In the wild joy of Soma had struck off with might the head of Vrtra, tyrant of the earth and heaven.",
   "01.052.11": "O Indra, were this earth extended forth tenfold, and men who dwell therein multiplied day by day, Still here thy conquering might, Maghavan, would be famed: it hath waxed vast as heaven in majesty and power.",
   "01.052.12": "Thou, bold of heart, in thine own native might, for help, upon the limit of this mid-air and of heaven, Hast made the earth to be the pattern of thy strength: embracing flood and light thou reachest to the sky.",
   "01.052.13": "Thou art the counterpart of earth, the Master of lofty heaven with all its mighty Heroes: Thou hast filled all the region with thy greatness: yea, of a truth there is none other like thee.",
   "01.052.14": "Whose amplitude the heaven and earth have not attained, whose bounds the waters of mid-air have never reached,- Not, when in joy he fights the stayer of the rain: thou, and none else, hast made all things in order due.",
   "01.052.15": "The Maruts sang thy praise in this encounter, and in thee all the Deities delighted, What time thou, Indra, with thy spiky weapon, thy deadly bolt, smotest the face of Vrtra.",
   "01.053.02": "Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley, thou art Lord and guard of wealth: Man's helper from of old, not disappointing hope, Friend of our friends, to thee ,as such we sing this praise.",
   "01.053.03": "Indra, most splendid, powerful, rich in mighty deeds, this treasure spread around is known to be thine own. Gather therefrom, O Conqueror, and bring to us: fail not the hope of him who loves and sings to thee.",
   "01.053.04": "Well pleased with these bright flames and with these Soma drops, take thou away our poverty with seeds and kine. With Indra scattering the Dasyu through these drops, freed from their hate may we obtain abundant food.",
   "01.053.05": "Let us obtain, O Indra, plenteous wealth and food, with strength exceeding glorious, shining to the sky: May we obtain the Goddess Providence, the strength of heroes, special source of cattle, rich in steeds.",
   "01.053.06": "These our libations strength-inspiring, Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with Vrtra, Hero Lord, What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand Vrtras, thou resistless in thy might.",
   "01.053.07": "Thou goest on from fight to fight intrepidly, destroying castle after castle here with strength. Thou, Indra, with thy friend who makes the foe bow down, slewest from far away the guileful Namuci.",
   "01.053.08": "Thou hast struck down in death Karanja, Parnaya, in Atithigva's very glorious going forth. Unyielding, when Rjisvan compassed them with siege, thou hast destroyed the hundred forts of Vangrida.",
   "01.053.09": "With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of men, With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Susravas.",
   "01.053.10": "Thou hast protected Susravas with succour, and Turvayana with thine aid, O Indra. Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Ayu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty.",
   "01.053.11": "May we protected by the Gods hereafter remain thy very prosperous friends, O Indra. Thee we extol, enjoying through thy favour life long and joyful and with store of heroes.",
   "01.054.01": "URGE us not, Maghavan, to this distressful fight, for none may comprehend the limit of thy strength. Thou with fierce shout hast made the woods and rivers roar: did not men run in crowds together in their fear?",
   "01.054.02": "Sing hymns of praise to Sakra, Lord of power and might; laud thou and magnify Indra who hearcth thee, Who with his daring might, a Bull exceeding strong in strength, maketh him master of the heaven and earth.",
   "01.054.03": "Sing forth to lofty Dyaus a strength-bestowing song, the Bold, whose resolute mind hath independent sway. High glory hath the Asura, compact of strength, drawn on by two Bay Steeds: a Bull, a Car is he.",
   "01.054.04": "The ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake; thou, daring, of thyself smotest through Sambara, When bold with gladdening juice, thou warredst with thy bolt, sharp and twoedged, against the banded sorcerers.",
   "01.054.05": "When with a roar that fills the woods, thou forcest down on wind's head the stores which 8usga kept confined, Who shall have power to stay thee firm and eager-souled from doing still this day what thou of old hast done?",
   "01.054.06": "Thou helpest Narya, Turvasa, and Yadu, and Vayya's son Turviti, Satakratu! Thou helpest horse and car in final battle thou breakest down the nine-and-ninety castles.",
   "01.054.07": "A hero-lord is he, King of a mighty folk, who offers free oblations and promotes the Law, Who with a bounteous guerdon welcomes hymns of praise: for him flows down the abundant stream below the sky.",
   "01.054.08": "His power is matchless, matchless is his wisdom; chief, through their work, be some who drink the Soma, Those, Indra, who increase the lordly power, the firm heroic strength of thee the Giver.",
   "01.054.09": "Therefore for thee are these abundant beakers Indra's drink, stone-pressed juices held in ladles. Quaff them and satisfy therewith thy longing; then fix thy mind upon bestowing treasure.",
   "01.054.10": "There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters' flow: in Vrtra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay concealed. But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following after flood, down steep declivitics.",
   "01.054.11": "So give us, Indra, bliss-increasing glory give us great sway and strength that conquers people. Preserve our wealthy patrons, save our princes; vouchsafe us wealth and food with noble offspring.",
   "01.055.01": "THOUGH e'en this heaven's wide space and earth have spread them out, nor heaven nor earth may be in greatness Indra's match. Awful and very mighty, causing woe to men, he whets his thunderbolt for sharpness, as a bull.",
   "01.055.02": "Like as the watery ocean, so doth he receive the rivers spread on all sides in their ample width. He bears him like a bull to drink of Soma juice, and will, as Warrior from of old, be praised for might.",
   "01.055.03": "Thou swayest, Indra, all kinds of great manly power, so as to bend, as't were, even that famed mountain down. Foremost among the Gods is he through hero might, set in the van, the Strong One, for each arduous deed.",
   "01.055.04": "He only in the wood is praised by worshippers, when he shows forth to men his own fair Indrapower. A friendly Bull is he, a Bull to be desired when Maghavan auspiciously sends forth his voice.",
   "01.055.05": "Yet verily the Warrior in his vigorous strength stirreth up with his might great battles for mankind; And men have faith in Indra, the respIendent One, what time he hurleth down his bolt, his dart of death.",
   "01.055.06": "Though, fain for glory, and with strength increased on earth, he with great might destroys the dwellings made with art, He makes the lights of heaven shine forth secure, he bids, exceeding wise, the floods flow for his worshipper.",
   "01.055.07": "Drinker of Soma, let thy heart incline to give; bring thy Bays hitherward, O thou who hearest praise. Those charioteers of' thine, best skilled to draw the rein, the rapid sunbeams, Indra, lead thee not astray.",
   "01.055.08": "Thou bearest in both hands treasure that never fails; the famed One in his body holds unvanquished might. O Indra, in thy members many powers abide, like wells surrounded by the ministering priests.",
   "01.056.02": "To him the guidance-following songs of praise flow full, as those who seek gain go in company to the flood. To him the Lord of power, the holy synod's might, as to a hill, with speed, ascend the loving ones.",
   "01.056.03": "Victorious, great is he; in manly battle shines, unstained with dust, his might, as shines a mountain peak; Wherewith the iron one, fierce e'en against the strong, in rapture, fettered wily Sushna fast in bonds.",
   "01.056.04": "When Strength the Goddess, made more strong for help by thee, waits upon Indra as the Sun attends the Dawn, Then. he who with his might unflinching kills the gloom stirs up the dust aloft, with joy and triumphing.",
   "01.056.05": "When thou with might, upon the framework of the heaven, didst fix, across, air's region firmly, unremoved, In the light-winning war, Indra, in rapturous joy, thou smotest Vrtra dead and broughtest floods of rain.",
   "01.056.06": "Thou with thy might didst grasp,the holder-up of heaven, thou who art mighty also in the seats of earth. Thou, gladdened by the juice, hast set the waters free, and broken Vrtra's stony fences through and through.",
   "01.057.02": "Now all this world, for worship, shall come after thee-the offerer's libations like floods to the depth, When the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thunderbolt of Indra, shatterer wrought of gold.",
   "01.057.03": "To him the terrible, most meet for lofty praise, like bright Dawn, now bring gifts with reverence in this rite, Whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been created, like bay steeds, to move with speed.",
   "01.057.04": "Thine, Indra, praised by many, excellently rich! are we who trusting in thy help draw near to thee. Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as earth loves all her creatures, love thou this our hymn.",
   "01.057.05": "Great is thy power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil, O Maghavan, the wish of this thy worshipper. After thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength: to thee and to thy power this earth hath bowed itself.",
   "01.057.06": "Thou, who hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast shattered into pieces this broad massive cloud. Thou hast sent down the obstructed floods that they may flow: thou hast, thine own for ever, all victorious might.",
   "01.058.02": "Never decaying, seizing his appropriate food, rapidly, eagerly through the dry wood he spreads. His back, as he is sprinkled, glistens like a horse: loud hath he roared and shouted like the heights of heaven?",
   "01.058.03": "Set high in place o'er all that Vasus, Rudras do, immortal, Lord of riches, seated as High Priest; Hastening like a car to men, to those who live, the God without delay gives boons to be desired.",
   "01.058.04": "Urged by the wind be spreads through dry wood as he lists, armed with his tongues for sickles, with a mighty roar. Black is thy path, Agni, changeless, with glittering waves! when like a bull thou rushest eager to the trees.",
   "01.058.05": "With teeth of flame, wind-driven, through the wood he speeds, triumphant like a bull among the herd of cows, With bright strength roaming to the everlasting air: things fixed, things moving quake before him as he flies.",
   "01.058.06": "The Bhrgus established thee among mankind for men, like as a treasure, beauteous, easy to invoke; Thee, Agni, as a herald and choice-worthy guest, as an auspicious Friend to the Celestial Race.",
   "01.058.07": "Agni, the seven tongues' deftest Sacrificer, him whom the priests elect at solemn worship, The Herald, messenger of all the Vasus, I serve with dainty food, I ask for riches.",
   "01.058.08": "Grant, Son of Strength, thou rich in friends, a refuge without a flaw this day to us thy praisers. O Agni, Son of Strength, with forts of iron preserve thou from distress the man who lauds thee.",
   "01.058.09": "Be thou a refuge, Bright One, to the singer, a shelter, Bounteous Lord, to those who worship. Preserve the singer from distress, O Agni. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.",
   "01.059.01": "THE other fires are, verily, thy branches; the Immortals all rejoice in thee, O Agni. Centre art thou, Vaigvdnara, of the people, sustaining men like a deep-founded pillar.",

   "01.158.01": "YE Vasus Twain, ye Rudras full of counsel, grant us, Strong Strengtheners, when ye stand beside us, What wealth Aucathya craves of you, great Helpers when ye come forward with no niggard succour.",
   "01.158.02": "Who may give you aught, Vasus, for your favour, for what, at the Cow's place, ye grant through worship? Wake for us understanding full of riches, come with a heart that will fulfil our longing.",
   "01.158.03": "As erst for Tugra's son your car, sea-crossing, strong, was equipped and set amid the waters, So may I gain your shelter and protection as with winged course a hero seeks his army.",
   "01.158.04": "May this my praise preserve Ucathya's offispring: let not these Twain who fly with wings exhaust me. Let not the wood ten times up-piled consume me, when fixed for you it bites the ground it stands on.",
   "01.158.05": "The most maternal streams, wherein the Dilsas cast me securely bound, have not devoured me. When Traitana would cleave my head asunder, the Dasa wounded his own breast and shoulders.",
   "01.158.06": "Dirghatamas the son of Mamati hath come to length of days in the tenth age of human kind. He is the Brahman of the waters as they strive to reach their end and aim: their charioteer is he.",
   "01.159.01": "I PRAISE with sacrifices mighty Heaven and Earth at festivals, the wise, the Strengtheners of Law. Who, having Gods for progeny, conjoined with Gods, through wonder-working wisdom bring forth choicest boons.",
   "01.159.02": "With invocations, on the gracious Father's mind, and on the Mother's great inherent power I muse. Prolific Parents, they have made the world of life, and for their brood all round wide immortality.",
   "01.159.03": "These Sons of yours well skilled in work, of wondrous power, brought forth to life the two great Mothers first of all. To keep the truth of all that stands and all that moves, ye guard the station of your Son who knows no guile.",
   "01.159.04": "They with surpassing skill, most wise, have measured out the Twins united in their birth and in their home. They, the refulgent Sages, weave within the sky, yea, in the depths of sea, a web for ever new.",
   "01.159.05": "This is to-day the goodliest gift of Savitar: this thought we have when now the God is furthering us. On us with loving-kindness Heaven and Earth bestow riches and various wealth and treasure hundredfold!",
   "01.160.01": "THESE, Heaven and Earth, bestow prosperity on all, sustainers of the region, Holy Ones and wise, Two Bowls of noble kind: between these Goddesses the God, the fulgent Sun, travels by fixed decree.",
   "01.160.02": "Widely-capacious Pair, mighty, that never fail, the Father and the Mother keep all creatures safe: The two world-halves, the spirited, the beautiful, because the Father hath clothed them in goodly forms.",
   "01.160.03": "Son of these Parents, he the Priest with power to cleanse, Sage, sanctifies the worlds with his surpassing power. Thereto for his bright milk he milked through all the days the party-coloured Cow and the prolific Bull.",
   "01.160.04": "Among the skilful Gods most skilled is he, who made the two world-halves which bring prosperity to all; Who with great wisdom measured both the regions out, and stablished them with pillars that shall ne'er decay.",
   "01.160.05": "Extolled in song, O Heaven and Earth, bestow on us, ye mighty Pair, great glory and high lordly sway, Whereby we may extend ourselves ever over the folk; and send us strength that shall deserve the praise of men.",
   "01.161.01": "WHY hath the Best, why hath the Youngest come to us? Upon what embassy comes he? What have we said? We have not blamed the chalice of illustrious birth. We, Brother Agni, praised the goodness of the wood.",
   "01.161.02": "The chalice that is single make ye into four: thus have the Gods commanded; therefore am I come. If, O Sudhanvan's Children, ye will do this thing ye shall participate in sacrifice with Gods.",
   "01.161.03": "What to the envoy Agni in reply ye spake, A courser must be made, a chariot fashioned here, A cow must be created, and the Twain made young. When we have done these things, Brother, we turn to you.",
   "01.161.04": "When thus, O Rbhus, ye had done ye questioned thus, Whither went he who came to us a messenger? Then Tvastar, when he viewed the four wrought chalices, concealed himself among the Consorts of the Gods.",
   "01.161.05": "As Tvastar thus had spoken, Let us slay these men who have reviled the chalice, drinking-cup of Gods, They gave themselves new names when Soma juice was shed, and under these new names the Maiden welcomed them.",
   "01.161.06": "Indra hath yoked his Bays, the Asvins' car is horsed, Brhaspati hath brought the Cow of every hue. Ye went as Rbhus, Vibhvan, Vaja to the Gods, and skilled in war, obtained your share in sacrifice.",
   "01.161.07": "Ye by your wisdom brought a cow from out a hide; unto that ancient Pair ye gave again their youth. Out of a horse, Sudhanvan's Sons, ye formed a horse: a chariot ye equipped, and went unto the Gods.",
   "01.161.08": "Drink ye this water, were the words ye spake to them; or drink ye this, the rinsing of the Munjagrass. If ye approve not even this, Sudhanvan's Sons, then at the third libation gladden ye yourselves.",
   "01.161.09": "Most excellent are waters, thus said one of you; most excellent is Agni, thus another said. Another praised to many a one the lightning cloud. Then did ye shape the cups, speaking the words of truth.",
   "01.161.10": "One downward to the water drives the crippled cow, another trims the flesh brought on the carving-board. One carries off the refuse at the set of sun. How did the Parents aid their children in their task!",
   "01.161.11": "On the high places ye have made the grass for man, and water in the valleys, by your skill, O Men. Rbhus, ye iterate not to-day that act of yours, your sleeping in the house of him whom naught can hide.",
   "01.161.12": "As, compassing them round, ye glided through the worlds, where had the venerable Parents their abode? Ye laid a curse on him who raised his arm at you: to him who spake aloud to you ye spake again.",
   "01.161.13": "When ye had slept your fill, ye Rbhus, thus ye asked, O thou whom naught may hide, who now hath wakened us? The goat declared the hound to be your wakener. That day, in a full year, ye first unclosed our eyes.",
   "01.161.14": "The Maruts move in heaven, on earth this Agni; through the mid-firmament the Wind approaches. Varuna comes in the sea's gathered waters, O Sons of Strength, desirous of your presence.",
   "01.162.01": "SLIGHT us not Varuna, Aryaman, or Mitra, Rbhuksan, Indra, Ayu, or the Maruts, When we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the strong Steed, God-descended.",
   "01.162.02": "What time they bear before the Courser, covered with trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation, The dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the place dear to Indra and to Pusan.",
   "01.162.03": "Dear. to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pusan, is first led forward with the vigorous Courser, While Tvastar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable for sacrifice, to glory.",
   "01.162.04": "When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who goeth to the Gods as meet oblation, The goat precedeth him, the share of Pusan, and to the Gods the sacrifice announceth.",
   "01.162.05": "Invoker, ministering priest, atoner, fire-kindler Soma-presser, sage, reciter, With this well ordered sacrifice, well finished, do ye fill full the channels of the rivers.",
   "01.162.06": "The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those who carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake; Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,-may the approving help of these promote our work.",
   "01.162.07": "Forth, for the regions of the Gods, the Charger with his smooth back is come my prayer attends him. In him rejoice the singers and the sages. A good friend have we won for the Gods' banquet.",
   "01.162.08": "May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the head-stall and the girths and cords about him. And the grass put within his mouth to bait him,-among the Gods, too, let all these be with thee.",
   "01.162.09": "What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left sticking to the post or hatchet, Or to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,-among the Gods, too, may all this be with thee.",
   "01.162.10": "Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of raw flesh remaining, This let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice with perfect cooking.",
   "01.162.11": "What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou art set upon the spit, distilleth, Let not that lie on earth or grass neglected, but to the longing Gods let all be offered.",
   "01.162.12": "They who observing that the Horse is ready call out and say, the smell is good; remove it; And, craving meat, await the distribution, -may their approving help promote labour.",
   "01.162.13": "The trial-fork of the flesh-cooking caldron, the vessels out of which the broth is sprinkled, The warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks, carving-boards,-all these attend the Charger.",
   "01.162.14": "The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes wherewith the Charger's feet were fastened, The water that he drank, the food he tasted, -among the Gods, too, may all these attend thee.",
   "01.162.15": "Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor glowing caldron smell and break to pieces. Offered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,-such Charger do the Gods accept with favour.",
   "01.162.16": "The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the upper covering and the golden trappings, The halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,-all these, as grateful to the Gods, they offer.",
   "01.162.17": "If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his heel or with his whip distressed thee, All these thy woes, as with the oblations' ladle at sacrifices, with my prayer I banish.",
   "01.162.18": "The four-and-thirty ribs of the. Swift Charger, kin to the Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces. Cut ye with skill, so that the parts be flawless, and piece by piece declaring them dissect them.",
   "01.162.19": "Of Tvastar's Charger there is one dissector,-this is the custom-two there are who guide him. Such of his limbs as I divide in order, these, amid the balls, in fire I offer.",
   "01.162.20": "Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the hatchet linger in thy body. Let not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints, mangle thy limbs unduly.",
   "01.162.21": "No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: by easy paths unto the Gods thou goest. Both Bays, both spotted mares are now thy fellows, and to the ass's pole is yoked the Charger.",
   "01.162.22": "May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in good kine,good horses, manly offspring. Freedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us: the Steed with our oblations gain us lordship!",
   "01.163.01": "WHAT time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding from the sea or upper waters, Limbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed, thy birth is nigh and must be lauded.",
   "01.163.02": "This Steed which Yama gave hath Trita harnessed, and him, the first of all, hath Indra mounted. His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the Sun ye fashioned forth the Courser.",
   "01.163.03": "Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art Aditya; Trita art thou by secret operation. Thou art divided thoroughly from Soma. They say thou hast three bonds in heaven that hold thee.",
   "01.163.04": "Three bonds, they say, thou hast in heaven that bind thee, three in the waters, three within the ocean. To me thou seernest Varuna , O Courser, there where they say is thy sublimest birth-place.",
   "01.163.05": "Here-, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee, here are the traces of thy hoofs as winner. Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which those who guard the holy Law keep safely.",
   "01.163.06": "Thyself from far I recognized in spirit,-a Bird that from below flew through the heaven. I saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled by dust, pleasant to travel.",
   "01.163.07": "Here I beheld thy form, matchless in glory, eager to win thee food at the Cow's station. Whene'er a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou swallowest the plants most greedy eater.",
   "01.163.08": "After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine come after, and the charm of maidens. Full companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern of thy vigour Gods have copied.",
   "01.163.09": "Horns made of gold hath he: his feet are iron: less fleet than he, though swift as thought, is Indra. The Gods have come that they may taste the oblation of him who mounted, first of all, the Courser.",
   "01.163.10": "Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like heroes, the Celestial Coursers Put forth their strength, like swans in lengthened order, when they, the Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway.",
   "01.163.11": "A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the wind in motion is thy spirit. Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions: they move with restless beat in wildernesses.",
   "01.163.12": "The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after.",
   "01.163.13": "The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.",
   "01.164.01": "OF this benignant Priest, with eld grey-coloured, the brother midmost of the three is lightning. The third is he whose back with oil is sprinkled. Here I behold the Chief with seven male children.",
   "01.164.02": "Seven to the one-wheeled chariot yoke the Courser; bearing seven names the single Courser draws it. Three-naved the wheel is, sound and undecaying, whereon are resting all these worlds of being.",
   "01.164.03": "The seven who on the seven-wheeled car are mounted have horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward. Seven Sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the names of the seven Cows are treasured.",
   "01.164.04": "Who hath beheld him as he sprang to being, seen how the boneless One supports the bony? Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may approach the man who knows, to ask it?",
   "01.164.05": "Unripe in mind, in spirit undiscerning, I ask of these the Gods' established places; For up above the yearling Calf the sages, to form a web, their own seven threads have woven.",
   "01.164.06": "I ask, unknowing, those who know, the sages, as one all ignorant for sake of knowledge, What was that ONE who in the Unborn's image hath stablished and fixed firm these worlds' six regions.",
   "01.164.07": "Let him who knoweth presently declare it , this lovely Bird's securely founded station. Forth from his head the Cows draw milk, and, wearing his vesture, with their foot have drunk the water.",
   "01.164.08": "The Mother gave the Sire his share of Order: with thought, at first, she wedded him in spirit. She, the coy Dame, was filled with dew prolific: with adoration men approached to praise her.",
   "01.164.09": "Yoked was the Mother to the boon Cow's car-pole: in the dank rows of cloud the Infant rested. Then the Calf lowed, and looked upon the Mother, the Cow who wears all shapes in three directions.",
   "01.164.10": "Bearing three Mothers and three Fathers, single he stood erect: they never make him weary. There on the pitch of heaven they speak together in speech all-knowing but not all-impelling.",
   "01.164.11": "Formed with twelve spokes, by length of time, unweakened, rolls round the heaven this wheel of during Order. Herein established, joined in pairs together, seven hundred Sons and twenty stand, O Agni.",
   "01.164.12": "They call him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed, of twelve forms, wealthy in watery store. These others say that he, God with far-seeing eyes, is mounted on the lower seven-wheeled, sixspoked car.",
   "01.164.13": "Upon this five-spoked wheel revolving ever all living creatures rest and are dependent. Its axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient time remains unbroken.",
   "01.164.14": "The wheel revolves, unwasting, with its felly: ten draw it, yoked to the far-stretching car-pole. The Sun's eye moves encompassed by the region: on him dependent rest all living creatures.",
   "01.164.15": "Of the co-born they call the seventh single-born; the six twin pairs are called Rsis, Children of Gods. Their good gifts sought of men are ranged in order due, and various in their form move for the Lord who guides.",
   "01.164.16": "They told me these were males, though truly females: he who hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not. The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this rightly is his father's father.",
   "01.164.17": "Beneath the upper realm, above this lower, bearing her calf at foot the Cow hath risen. Witherward, to what place hath she departed? Where calves she? Not amid this herd of cattle.",
   "01.164.18": "Who, that the father of this Calf discerneth beneath the upper realm, above the lower, Showing himself a sage, may here declare it? Whence hath the Godlike spirit had its rising?",
   "01.164.19": "Those that come hitherward they call departing, those that depart they call directed hither. And what so ye have made, Indra and Soma, steeds bear as 'twere yoked to the region's car-pole.",
   "01.164.20": "Two Birds with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, in the same sheltering tree have found a refuge. One of the twain eats the sweet Fig-tree's fruitage; the other eating not regardeth only.",
   "01.164.21": "Where those fine Birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eternal, and the sacred synods, There is the Universe's mighty Keeper, who, wise, hath entered into me the simple.",
   "01.164.22": "The, tree whereon the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they all rest and procreate their offspring,- Upon its top they say the fig is luscious none gaineth it who knoweth not the Father.",
   "01.164.23": "How on the Gayatri. the Gayatri was based, how from the Tristup they fashioned the Tristup forth, How on the Jagati was based the Jagati,- they who know this have won themselves immortal life.",
   "01.164.24": "With Gayatri he measures out the praise-song, Sama with praise-song, triplet with the Tristup. The triplet witli the two or four-foot measure, and with the syllable they form seven metres.",
   "01.164.25": "With Jagati the flood in heaven he stablished, and saw the Sun in the Rathantara Saman. Gavatri hath, they say, three brands for kindling: hence it excels in majesty and vigour.",
   "01.164.26": "I invocate the milch-cow good for milking so that the milker, deft of hand, may drain her. May Savitar give goodliest stimulation. The caldron is made hot; I will proclaim it.",
   "01.164.27": "She, lady of all treasure, is come hither yearning in spirit for her calf and lowing. May this cow yield her milk for both the Asvins, and may she prosper to our high advantage.",
   "01.164.28": "The cow hath lowed after her blinking youngling; she licks his forehead, as she lows, to form it. His mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder, and suckles him with milk while gently lowing.",
   "01.164.29": "He also snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow laws as she clings unto the shedder of the rain. She with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal man, and, turned to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.",
   "01.164.30": "That which hath breath and speed and life and motion lies firmly stablished in the midst of houses. Living, by offerings to the Dead he moveth Immortal One, the brother of the mortal.",
   "01.164.31": "I saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching by his pathways and departing. He, clothed with gathered and diffusive splendour, within the worlds continually travels.",
   "01.164.32": "He who hath made him cloth not comprehend him: from him who saw him surely is he hidden. He, yet enveloped in his Mother's bosom, source of much life, hath sunk into destruction.",
   "01.164.33": "Dyaus is my Father, my begetter: kinship is here. This great earth is my kin and Mother. Between the wide-spread world-halves is the birthb-place: the Father laid the Daughter's germ within it.",
   "01.164.34": "ask thee of the earth's extremest limit, where is the centre of the world, I ask thee.",
   "01.164.35": "This altar is the earth's extremest limit; this sacrifice of ours is the world's centre. The Stallion's seed prolific is the Soma; this Brahman highest heaven where Speech abideth.",
   "01.164.36": "Seven germs unripened yet are heaven's prolific, seed: their functions they maintain by Visnu's ordinance. Endued with wisdom through intelligence and thought, they compass us about present on every side.",
   "01.164.37": "What thing I truly am I know not clearly: mysterious, fettered in my mind I wander. When the first-born of holy Law approached me, then of this speech I first obtain a portion.",
   "01.164.38": "Back, forward goes he, grasped by strength inherent, the Immortal born the brother of the mortal Ceaseless they movelnopposite directions: men mark the one, and fail to mark the other.",
   "01.164.39": "Upon what syllable of holy praise-song, as twere their highest heaven, the Gods repose them,- Who knows not this, what will he do with praise-song? But they who know it well sit here assembled.",
   "01.164.40": "Forunate mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also be exceeding wealthy. Feed on the grass, O Cow, at every season, and coming hitherward drink limpid water.",
   "01.164.41": "Forming the water-floods, the buffalo hath lowed, one-footed or two-footed or fourfooted, she, Who hath become eight-footed or hath got nine feet, the thou sand-syllabled in the sublimest heaven.",
   "01.164.42": "From her descend in streams the seas of water; thereby the world's four regions have their being, Thence flows the imperishable flood and thence the universe hath life.",
   "01.164.43": "I saw from far away the smoke of fuel with spires that rose on high o'er that beneath it. The Mighty Men have dressed the spotted bullock. These were the customs in the days aforetime,",
   "01.164.44": "Three with long tresses show in ordered season. One of them sheareth when the year is ended. One with his powers the universe regardeth: Of one, the sweep is seen, but his figure.",
   "01.164.45": "Speech hath been measured out in four divisions, the Brahmans who have understanding know them. Three kept in close concealment cause no motion; of speech, men speak only the fourth division.",
   "01.164.46": "They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutman. To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Matarisvan.",
   "01.164.47": "Dark the descent: the birds are golden-coloured; up to the heaven they fly robed in the waters. Again descend they from the seat of Order, and all the earth is moistened with their fatness.",
   "01.164.48": "Twelve are the fellies, and the wheel is single; three are the naves. What man hath understood it? Therein are set together spokes three hundred and sixty, which in nowise can be loosened.",
   "01.164.49": "That breast of thine exhaustless, spring of pleasure, wherewith thou feedest all things that are choicest, Wealth-giver, treasure. finder, free bestower,-bring that, Sarasvati, that we may drain it.",
   "01.164.50": "By means of sacrifice the Gods accomplished their sacrifice: these were the earliest ordinances. These Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sadhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.",
   "01.164.51": "Uniform, with the passing days, this water mounts and fails again. The tempest-clouds give life to earth, and fires re-animate the heaven.",
   "01.164.52": "The Bird Celestial, vast with noble pinion, the lovely germ of plants, the germ of waters, Him who delighteth us with rain in season, Sarasvan I invoke that he may help us.",
   "01.165.01": "WITH what bright beauty are the Maruts jointly invested, peers in age, who dwell together? From what place have they come? With what intention? Sing they their strength through love of wealth, these Heroes?",
   "01.165.02": "Whose prayers have they, the Youthful Ones, accepted? Who to his sacrifice hath turned the Maruts? We will delay them on their journey sweeping-with what high spirit!-through the air like eagles.",
   "01.165.03": "Whence comest thou alone, thou who art mighty, Indra, Lord of the Brave? What is thy purpose? Thou greetest us when meeting us the Bright Ones. Lord of Bay Steeds, say what thou hast against us.",
   "01.165.04": "Mine are devotions, hymns; sweet are libations. Strength stirs, and hurled forth is my bolt of thunder. They call for me, their lauds are longing for me. These my Bay Steeds bear me to these oblations.",
   "01.165.05": "Therefore together with our strong companions, having adorned our bodies, now we harness, Our spotted deer with might, for thou, O Indra, hast learnt and understood our Godlike nature.",
   "01.165.06": "Where was that nature then of yours, O Maruts, that ye charged me alone to slay the Dragon? For I in truth am fierce and strong and mighty. I bent away from every foeman's weapons.",
   "01.165.07": "Yea, much hast thou achieved with us for comrades, with manly valour like thine own, thou Hero. Much may we too achieve, O mightiest Indra, with our great power, we Maruts, when we will it.",
   "01.165.08": "Vrtra I slew by mine own strength, O Maruts, having waxed mighty in mine indignation. I with the thunder in my hand created for man these lucid softly flowing waters.",
   "01.165.09": "Nothing, O Maghavan, stands firm before thee; among the Gods not one is found thine equal. None born or springing into life comes nigh thee. Do what thou hast to do, exceeding mighty?",
   "01.165.10": "Mine only be transcendent power, whatever I, daring in my spirit, may accomplish. For I am known as terrible, O Maruts I, Indra, am the Lord of what I ruined.",
   "01.165.11": "Now, O ye Maruts, hath your praise rejoiced me, the glorious hymn which ye have made me, Heroes! For me, for Indra, champion strong in battle, for me, yourselves, as lovers for a lover.",
   "01.165.12": "Here, truly, they send forth their sheen to meet me, wearing their blameless glory and their vigour. When I have seen you, Matuts, in gay splendour, ye have delighted me, so now delight me.",
   "01.165.13": "Who here hath magnified you, O ye Maruts? speed forward, O ye lovers, to your lovers. Ye Radiant Ones, assisting their devotions, of these my holy rites he ye regardful.",
   "01.165.14": "To this hath Minya's wisdom brought us, so as to aid, as aids the poet him who worships. Bring hither quick! On to the sage, ye Maruts! These prayers for you the singer hath recited.",
   "01.165.15": "May this your praise, may this your song, O Maruts, sung by the poet, Mana's son, Mandarya, Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance!",

   "03.030.15": "Barring the way they come. Be firm, O Indra; aid friends to sacrifice and him who singeth. These must be slain by thee, malignant mortals, armed with ill arts, our quiverbearing foemen.",
   "03.030.16": "A cry is beard from enemies most near us: against them send thy fiercest-flaming weapon. Rend them from under, crush them and subdue them. Slay, Maghavan, and make the fiends our booty.",
   "03.030.17": "Root up the race of Raksasas, O Indra rend it in front and crush it in the middle. How long hast thou bebaved as one who wavers? Cast thy hot dart at him who hates devotion:",

   "03.031.02": "The Son left not his portion to the brother, he made a home to hold him who should gain, it. What time his Parents gave the Priest his being, of the good pair one acted, one promoted.",
   "03.031.03": "Agni was born trembling with tongue that flickered, so that the Red's great children should be honoured. Great is their germ, that born of them is mighty, great the Bays' Lord's approach through sacrifices.",
   "03.031.04": "Conquering bands upon the Warrior waited: they recognized great light from out the darkness. The conscious Dawns went forth to meet his coming, and the sole Master of the kine was Indra.",
   "03.031.05": "The sages freed them from their firmbuilt prison: the seven priests drove them forward with their spirit. All holy Order's pathway they discovered he, full of knowledge, shared these deeds through worship.",
   "03.031.06": "When Sarama had found the mountain's fissure, that vast and ancient place she plundered thoroughly. In the floods' van she led them forth, light-footed: she who well knew came first unto their lowing.",

   "03.031.08": "Peer of each noble thing, yea, all excelling, all creatures doth he know, he slayeth Susna. Our leader, fain for war, singing from heaven, as Friend he saved his lovers from dishonour.",
   "03.031.09": "They sate them down with spirit fain for booty, making with hymns a way to life eternal. And this is still their place of frequent session, whereby they sought to gain the months through Order.",
   "03.031.10": "Drawing the milk of ancient seed prolific, they joyed as they beheld their own possession. Their shout of triumph heated earth and heaven. When the kine showed, they bade the heroes rouse them.",
   "03.031.11": "Indra drove forth the kine, that Vrtra-slayer, while hymns of praise rose up and gifts were offered. For him the Cow, noble and far-extending, poured pleasant juices, bringing oil and sweetness.",

   "03.031.16": "Vast, the House-Friend, he set the waters flowing, all-lucid, widely spread, that move together. By the wise cleansings of the meath made holy, through days, and nights they speed the swift streams onward.",
   "03.031.17": "To thee proceed the dark, the treasure-holders, both of them sanctified by Surya's bounty. The while thy ovely storming Friends, O Indra, fail to attain the measure of thy greatness.",
   "03.031.18": "Be Lord of joyous songs, O Vrtra-slayer, Bull dear to all, who gives the power of living. Come unto us with thine auspicious friendship, hastening, Mighty One, with mighty succours.",

   "03.032.04": "They, even the Maruts who were there, excited with song the meath-created strength of Indra. By them impelled to act he reached the vitals Of Vrtra, though he deemed that none might wound him.",
   "03.032.05": "Pleased, like a man, with our libation, Indra, drink, for enduring hero might, the Soma. Lord of Bays, moved by sacrifice come hither: thou with the Swift Ones stirrest floods and waters.",

   "04.005.01": "How shall we give with one accord oblation to Agni, to Vaisvanara the Bounteous? Great light, with full high growth hath he uplifted, and, as a pillar bears the roof, sustains it.",

   "04.005.03": "Sharp-pointed, powerful, strong, of boundless vigour, Agni who knows the lofty hymn, kept secret As the lost milch-cow's track, the doubly Mighty,-he hath declared to me this hidden knowledge.",
   "04.005.04": "May he with sharpened teeth, the Bounteous Giver, Agni, consume with flame most fiercely glowing. Those who regard not Varuna's commandments and the dear stedfast laws of sapient Mitra.",
   "04.005.05": "Like youthful women without brothers, straying, like dames who hate their lords, of evil conduct, They who are full of sin, untrue, unfaithful, they have engendered this abysmal station.",

   "04.005.13": "What is the limit, what the rules, the guerdon? Like fleet-foot coursers speed we to the contest. When will the Goddesses, the Immortal's Spouses, the Dawns, spread over us the Sun-God's splendour?",
   "04.005.14": "Unsatisfied, with speech devoid of vigour, scanty and frivolous and inconclusive, Wherefore do they address thee here, O Agni? Let these who have no weapons suffer sorrow.",
   "04.005.15": "The majesty of him the Good, the Mighty, aflame, hath shone for glory in the dwelling. He, clothed in light, hath shone most fair to look on, wealthy in boons, as a home shines with riches.",
   "04.006.01": "PRIEST of our rite, stand up erect, O Agni, in the Gods' service best of sacrificers, For over evei y thought thou art the Ruler: thou furtherest e'en the wisdom of the pious.",
   "04.006.02": "He was set down mid men as Priest unerring, Agni, wise, welcome in our holy synods. Like Savitar he hath lifted up his splendour, and like a builder raised his smoke to heaven.",
   "04.006.03": "The glowing ladle, filled with oil, is lifted; choosing Gods' service to the right he circles. Eager he rises like the new-wrought pillar which, firmly set and fixed, anoints the victims.",
   "04.006.04": "When sacred grass is strewn and Agni kindled, the Adhvaryu rises to, his task rej o cing. Agni the Priest, like one who tends the cattle, goes three times round, as from of old he wills it.",
   "04.006.05": "Agni himself, the Priest, with measured motion, goes round, with sweet speech, cheerful, true to Order. His fulgent flames run forth like vigorous horses; all creatures are affrighted when he blazes.",

   "04.006.07": "Naught hindered his production, Bounteous Giver: his Mother and his Sire were free to send him. Then as Friend benevolent, refulgent, Agni shone forth in human habitations.",
   "04.006.08": "He, Agni, whom the twice-five sisters, dwelling together, in the homes of men engendered, Bright like a spear's tooth, wakened in the morning, with powerful mouth and like an axe wellsharpened.",

   "04.006.10": "These brightly-shining games of thine, O Agni, that move for ever restless, allsubduing, Like falcons hasting eagerly to the quarry, roar loudly like the army of the Maruts.",
   "04.006.11": "To thee, O flaming God, hath prayer been offered. Let the priest laud thee: give to him who worships. Men have established Agni as Invoker, fain to adore the glory of the living.",

   "04.007.02": "When shall thy glory as a God, Agni, be suddenly shown forth. For mortal men have held thee fast, adorable in all their homes,",
   "04.007.03": "Seeing thee faithful to the Law, most sapient, like the starry heaven, Illumining with cheerful ray each solemn rite in every house.",
   "04.007.04": "Vivasvan's envoy living men have taken as their ensign, swift, The ruler over all mankind, moving like Bhrgu in each home.",
   "04.007.05": "Him the intelligent have they placed duly as Invoking Priest, Welcome, with sanctifying flame, best worshipper, with sevenfold might;",
   "04.007.06": "In his Eternal Mothers, in the wood, concealed and unapproached, Kept secret though his flames are bright seekingon all sides, quickly found.",

   "04.007.09": "Bright God, thy path is black: light is before thee: thy moving splendour is the chief of wonders. When she, yet unimpregnate, hath conceived thee, even when newly born thou art an envoy.",
   "04.007.10": "Yet newly born, his vigour is apparent when the wind blows upon his fiery splendour, His sharpened tongue he layeth on the brushwood, and with his teeth e'en solid food consumeth.",
   "04.007.11": "When he hath borne off food with swift flame swiftly, strong Agni makes himself a speedy envoy, Follows the rustling of the wind, consuming, and courser-like, speeds, drives the swift horse onward.",

   "04.008.02": "He, Mighty, knows the gift of wealth, he knows the deep recess of heaven: He shall bring hitherward the Gods.",
   "04.008.03": "He knows, a God himself, to guide Gods to the righteous in his home: He gives e'en treasures that we love.",
   "04.008.04": "He is the Herald: well-informed, he doth his errand to and fro, Knowing the deep recess of heaven.",

   "04.026.07": "The Falcon took and brought the Soma, bearing thousand libations with him, yea, ten thousand. The Bold One left Malignities behind him, wise, in wild joy of Soma, left the foolish.",
   "04.027.01": "I, As I lay within the womb, considered all generations of these Gods in order. A hundred iron fortresses confined me but forth I flew with rapid speed a Falcon.",
   "04.027.02": "Not at his own free pleasure did he bear me: he conquered with his strength and manly courage. Straightway the Bold One left the fiends behind him and passed the winds as he grew yet more mighty.",
   "04.027.03": "When with loud cry from heaven down sped the Falcon, thence hasting like the wind he bore the Bold One. Then, wildly raging in his mind, the archer Krsanu aimed and loosed the string to strike him.",
   "04.027.04": "The Falcon bore him from heaven's lofty summit as the swift car of Indra's Friend bore Bhujyu. Then downward bither fell a flying feather of the Bird hasting forward in his journey.",
   "04.027.05": "And now let Maghavan accept the beaker, white, filled with milk, filled with the shining liquid; The best of sweet meath which the priests have offered: that Indra to his joy may drink, the Hero, that he may take and drink it to his rapture.",
   "04.028.01": "ALLIED with thee, in this thy friendship, Soma, Indra for man made waters flow together, Slew Ahi, and sent forth the Seven Rivers, and opened as it were obstructed fountains.",
   "04.028.02": "Indu, with thee for his confederate, Indra swiftly with might pressed down the wheel of Surya. What rolled, all life's support, on heaven's high summit was separated from the great oppressor.",
   "04.028.03": "Indra smote down, Agni consumed, O Indu, the Dasyus ere the noontide in the conflict. Of those who gladly sought a hard-won dwelling he cast down many a thousand with his arrow.",
   "04.028.04": "Lower than all besides hast thou, O Indra, cast down the Dasyus, abject tribes of Dasas. Ye drave away, ye put to death the foemen, and took great vengeance with your murdering weapons.",
   "04.028.05": "So, of a truth, Indra and Soma, Heroes, ye burst the stable of the kine and horses, The stable which the bar or stone obstructed; and piercing through set free the habitations.",
   "04.029.01": "COME, lauded, unto us with powers and succours, O Indra, with thy Tawny Steeds; exulting, Past even the foeman's manifold libations, glorified with our hymns, true Wealth-bestower.",
   "04.029.02": "Man's Friend, to this our sacrifice he cometh marking how he is called by Soma-pressers. Fearless, and conscious that his Steeds are noble, he joyeth with the Soma-pouring heroes.",
   "04.029.03": "Make his cars hear, that he may show his vigour and may be joyful in the way he loveth. May mighty Indra pouring forth in bounty bestow on us good roads and perfect safety;",
   "04.029.04": "He who with succour comes to his implorer, the singer here who with his song invites him; He who himself sets to the pole swift Coursers, he who hath hundreds, thousands, Thunder-wielder.",
   "04.029.05": "O Indra Maghavan, by thee protected may we be thine, princes and priests and singers, Sharing the riches sent from lofty heaven which yields much food, and all desire its bounty.",
   "04.030.01": "O INDRA, Vrtra-slayer, none is better, mightier than thou: Verily there is none like thee.",
   "04.030.02": "Like chariot-wheels these people all together follow after thee: Thou ever art renowned as Great.",
   "04.030.03": "Not even all the gathered Gods conquered thee, Indra, in the war, When thou didst lengthen days by night.",
   "04.030.04": "When for the sake of those oppressed, and Kutsa as he battled, Thou stolest away the Sun's car-wheel.",
   "04.030.05": "When, fighting singly, Indra. thou o'ercamest all the furious Gods, thou slewest those who strove with thee.",
   "04.030.06": "When also for a mortal man, Indra, thou speddest forth the Sun, And holpest Etasa with might.",
   "04.030.07": "What? Vrtra-slayer, art not thou, Maghavan, fiercest in thy wrath? So hast thou quelled the demon too.",
   "04.030.08": "And this heroic deed of might thou, Indra, also hast achieved, That thou didst smite to death the Dame, Heaven's Daughter, meditating ill.",
   "04.030.09": "Thou, Indra, Mighty One, didst crush Usas, though Daughter of the Sky. When lifting up herself in pride.",
   "04.030.10": "Then from her chariot Usas fled, affrighted, from her ruined car. When the strong God had shattered it.",
   "04.030.11": "So there this car of Usas lay, broken to pieces, in Vipas, And she herself fled far away.",
   "04.030.12": "Thou, Indra, didst. with magic power resist the overflowing stream Who spread her waters o'er the land.",
   "04.030.13": "Valiantly didst thou seize and take the store which Susna had amassed, When thou didst crush his fortresses.",
   "04.030.14": "Thou, Indra, also smotest down Kulitara's son Sambara, The Dasa, from the lofty hill.",
   "04.030.15": "Of Dasa Varcin's thou didst slay the hundred thousand and the five, Crushed like the fellies, of a car.",
   "04.030.16": "So Indra, Lord of Heroes, Powers, caused the unwedded damsel's son, The castaway, to share the lauds.",
   "04.030.17": "So sapient Indra, Lord of Might, brought Turvaga and Yadu, those Who feared the flood, in safel o'er.",
   "04.030.18": "Arpa and Citraratha, both Aryas, thou, Indra, slewest swift, On yonder side of Sarayu,",
   "04.030.19": "Thou, Vrtra-slayer, didst conduct those two forlorn, the blind, the lame. None may attain this bliss of thine.",
   "04.030.20": "For Divodasa, him who brought oblationt, 1ndra overthrew A hundred fortresses of stone.",
   "04.030.21": "The thirty thousand Disas he with magic power and weapons sent To slumber, for Dabhiti's sake.",
   "04.030.22": "As such, O Vrtra-slayer, thou art general Lord of kine for all, Thou Shaker of all things that be.",
   "04.030.23": "Indra, whatever deed of might thou hast this day to execute, None be there now to hinder it.",
   "04.030.24": "O Watchful One, may Aryaman the God give thee all goodly things. May Risan, Bhaga, and the God Karulati give all things fair.",
   "04.031.01": "WITH what help will he come to us, wonderful, ever-waxing Friend; With what most mighty company?",
   "04.031.02": "What genuine and most liberal draught will spirit thee with juice to burst Open e'en strongly-guarded wealth?",
   "04.031.03": "Do thou who art Protector of us thy friends who praise thee With hundred aids approach us.",
   "04.031.04": "Like as a courser's circling wheel, so turn thee hitherward to us, Attracted by the hymns of men.",
   "04.031.05": "Thou seekest as it were thine own stations with swift descent of powers: I share thee even with the Sun.",
   "04.031.06": "What time thy courage and his wheels together, Indra, run their course With thee and with the Sun alike,",
   "04.031.07": "So even, Lord of Power and Might, the people call thee Maghavan, Giver, who pauses not to think.",
   "04.031.08": "And verily to him who toils and presses Soma juice for thee Thou quickly givest ample wealth.",
   "04.031.09": "No, not a hundred hinderers can check thy gracious bounty's flow, Nor thy great deeds when thou wilt act.",
   "04.031.10": "May thine assistance keep us safe, thy hundred and thy thousand aids: May all thy favours strengthen us.",
   "04.031.11": "Do thou elect us this place for friendship and prosperity, And great celestial opulence.",
   "04.031.12": "Favour us, Indra, evermore with overflowing store of wealth: With all thy succours aid thou us.",
   "04.031.13": "With new protections, Indra, like an archer, open thou forus The stables that are filled with kine.",
   "04.031.14": "Our chariot, Indra, boldly moves endued with splendour, ne'er repulsed, Winning for us both kine andsteeds.",
   "04.031.15": "O Surya, make our fame to be most excellent among the Gods, Most lofty as the heaven on high.",
   "04.032.01": "O THOU who slewest Vrtra, come, O Indra, hither to our side, Mighty One with thy mighty aids.",
   "04.032.02": "Swift and impetuous art thou, wondrous amid the well-dressed folk: Thou doest marvels for our help.",
   "04.032.03": "Even with the weak thou smitest down him who is stronger, with thy strength The mighty, with the Friends thou hast.",
   "04.032.04": "O Indra, we are close to thee; to thee we sing aloud our songs: Help hnd defend us, even us.",

   "04.033.05": "Two beakers let us make,- thus said the eldest. Lct us make three,- this was the younger's sentence. Four beakers let us make,- thus spoke the youngest. Tvastar approved this rede of yours, O Rbhus.",
   "04.033.06": "The men spake truth and even so they acted: this Godlike way of theirs the Rbhus followed. And Tvastar, when he looked on the four beakers resplendent as the day, was moved with envy.",

   "04.034.01": "To this our sacrifice come Rbhu, Vibhvan, Vaja, and Indra with the gift of riches, Because this day hath Dhisana the Goddess set drink for you: the gladdening draughts have reached you.",
   "04.034.02": "Knowing your birth and rich in gathered treasure, Rbhus, rejoice together with the Rtus. The gladdening draughts and wisdom have approached you: send ye us riches with good store of heroes.",

   "04.035.02": "Hither is come the Rbhus' gift of riches; here was the drinking of the well-pressed Soma, Since by dexterity and skill as craftsmen ye made the single chalice to be fourfold",
   "04.035.03": "Ye made fourfold the chalice that wag single: ye spake these words and said, O Friend, assist us; Then, Vajas! gained the path of life eternal, deft-handed Rbhus, to the Gods' assembly.",
   "04.035.04": "Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom? Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O Rbhus, of die meath of Soma.",
   "04.035.05": "Ye with your cunning made your Parents youthful; the cup, for Gods to drink, ye formed with cunning; With cunning, Rbhus, rich in treasure, fashioned the two swift Tawny Steeds who carry Indra.",
   "04.035.06": "Whoso pours out for you, when days are closing, the sharp libation for your joy, O Vajas, For him, O mighty Rbhus, ye, rejoicing, have fashioned wealth with plenteous store of heroes.",
   "04.035.07": "Lord of Bay Steeds, at dawn thejuice thou drankest: thine, only thine, is the noonday libation. Now drink thou with the wealth-bestowing Rbhus, whom for their skill thou madest friends, O Indra.",
   "04.035.08": "Ye, whom your artist skill hath raised to Godhead have set you down above in heaven like falcons. So give us riches, Children of Sudhanvan, O Sons of Strength; ye have become immortal.",
   "04.035.09": "The third libation, that bestoweth treasure, which ye have won by skill, ye dexterous-handed,- This drink hath been effused for you, O Rbhus . drink it with high delight, with joy like Indra's.",
   "04.036.01": "THia car that was not made for horses or for reins, three-wheeled, worthy of lauds, rolls round the firmament. That is the great announcement of your Deity, that, O ye Rbhus, ye sustain the earth and heaven.",
   "04.036.02": "Ye Sapient Ones who made the lightly-rolling car out of your mind, by thought, the car that never errs, You, being such, to drink of this drinkoffering, you, O ye Vajas, and ye Rbhus, we invoke.",
   "04.036.03": "O Vajas, Rbhus, reaching far, among the Gods this was your exaltation gloriously declared, In that your aged Parents, worn with length of days, ye wrought again to youth so that they moved at will.",
   "04.036.04": "The chalice that wag single ye have made fourfold, and by your wisdom brought the Cow forth from the hide. So quickly, mid the Gods, ye gained immortal life. Vajas and Rbhus, your great work must be extolled.",
   "04.036.05": "Wealth from the Rbhus is most glorious in renown, that which the Heroes, famed for vigour, have produced. In synods must be sung the car which Vibhvan wrought: that which ye favour, Gods! is famed among mankind.",
   "04.036.06": "Strong is the steed, the man a sage in eloquence, the bowman is a hero hard to beat in fight, Great store of wealth and manly power hath he obtained whom Vaja, Vibhvan, Rbhus have looked kindly on.",
   "04.036.07": "To you hath been assigned the fairest ornament, the hymn of praise: Vajas and Rbhus, joy therein; For ye have lore and wisdom and poetic skill: as such, with this our prayer we call on you to come.",

   "04.037.01": "COME to our sacrifice, Vajas, Rbhuksans, Gods, by the paths which Gods are wont to travel, As ye, gay Gods, accept in splendid weather the sacrifice among these folk of Manus.",
   "04.037.02": "May these rites please you in your heart and spirit; may the drops clothed in oil this day approach you. May the abundant juices bear you onward to power and strength, and, when imbibed, delight you.",
   "04.037.03": "Your threefold going near is God-appointed, so praise is given you, Vajas and Rbhuksans. So, Manus-like, mid younger folk I offer, to you who are aloft in heaven, the Soma.",

   "04.037.07": "O Vajas and Rbhuksans, free for us the paths to sacrifice, Ye Princes, lauded, that we may press forward to each point of heaven.",
   "04.037.08": "O Vajas and Rbhuksans, ye Nasatyas, Indra, bless this wealth, And, before other men's, the steed, that ample riches may be won.",
   "04.038.01": "FROM you two came the gifts in days aforetime which Trasadasyu granted to the Purus. Ye gave the winner of our fields and plough-lands, and the strong smiter who subdued the Dasytis.",
   "04.038.02": "And ye gave mighty Dadhikras, the giver of many gifts, who visiteth all people, Impetuous hawk, swift and of varied colour, like a brave King whom each true man must honour.",
   "04.038.03": "Whom, as 'twere down a precipice, swift rushing, each Puru praises and his heart rejoices,- Springing forth like a hero fain for battle, whirling the car and flying like the tempest.",
   "04.038.04": "Who gaineth precious booty in the combats and moveth, winning spoil, among the cattle; Shown in bright colour, looking on the assemblies, beyond the churl, to worship of the living.",
   "04.038.05": "Loudly the folk cry after him in battles, as 'twere a thief who steals away a garment; Speeding to glory, or a herd of cattle, even as a hungry falcon swooping downward.",
   "04.038.06": "And, fain to come forth first amid these armies, this way and that with rows of cars he rushes, Gay like a bridesman, making him a garland, tossing the dust, champing the rein that holds him.",
   "04.038.07": "And that strong Steed, victorious and faithful, obedient with his body in the combat, Speeding straight on amid the swiftly ressing, casts o'er his brows the dust he tosses upward.",
   "04.038.08": "And at his thunder, like the roar of heaven, those who attack tremble and are affrighted; For when he fights against embattled thousands, dread is he in his striving; none may stay him.",
   "04.038.09": "The people praise the overpowering swiftness of this fleet Steed who giveth men abundance. Of him they say when drawing back from battle. Dadhikras hath sped forward with his thousands.",
   "04.038.10": "Dadhikras hath o'erspread the Fivefold People with vigour, as the Sun lightens the waters. May the strong Steed who winneth bundreds, thousands, requite with sweetness these my words and praises.",
   "04.039.01": "Now give we praise to Dadhikras the rapid, and mention in our laud the Earth and Heaven. May the Dawns flushing move me to exertion, and bear me safely over every trouble.",
   "04.039.02": "I praise the mighty Steed who fills my spirit, the Stallion Dadhikravan rich in bounties, Whom, swift of foot aind shining bright as Agni, ye, Varuna and Mitra, gave to Purus.",
   "04.039.03": "Him who hath honoured, when the flame is kindled at break of dawn, the Courser Dadhikrivan, Him, of one mind with Varuna and Mitra may Aditi make free from all transgression.",
   "04.039.04": "When we remember mighty Dadhikravan our food and strength, then the blest name of Maruts, Varuna, Mitra, we invoke for welfare, and Agni, and the thunder-wielding Indra.",
   "04.039.05": "Both sides invoke him as they call on Indra when they stir forth and turn to sacrificing. To us have Varuna and Mitra granted the Courser Dadhikris, a guide for mortals.",
   "04.039.06": "So have I glorified with praise strong Dadhikravan, conquering Steed. Sweet may he make our mouths; may he prolong the days we have to live.",
   "04.040.01": "LET us recite the praise of Dadhikravan: may all the Mornings move me to exertion; Praise of the Lord of Waters, Dawn, and Agni, Brhaspati Son of Angiras, and Surya.",
   "04.040.02": "Brave, seeking war and booty, dwelling with the good and with the swift, may he hasten the food of Dawn. May he the true, the fleet, the lover of the course, the bird-like Dadhikravan, bring food, strength, and light.",
   "04.040.03": "His pinion, rapid runner, fans him m his way, as of a bird that hastens onward to its aim, And, as it were a falcon's gliding through the air, strikes Dadhikravan's side as he speeds on with might.",
   "04.040.04": "Bound by the neck and by the flanks and by the mouth, the vigorous Courser lends new swiftness to his speed. Drawing himself together, as his strength allows, Dadhikras springs along the windings of the paths.",
   "04.040.05": "The Hamsa homed in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the priest beside the altar, in the house the guest, Dweller in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born of flood, kine, truth, mountain, he is holy Law.",
   "04.041.01": "WHAT laud, O Indra-Varuna, with oblation, hath like the Immortal Priest obtained your favour? Hath our effectual laud, addressed with homage, touched you, O Indra-Varuna, in spirit?",
   "04.041.02": "He who with dainty food hath won you, Indra and Varuna, Gods, as his allies to friendship, Jayeth the Vrtras and his foes in battles, and through your mighty favours is made famous.",
   "04.041.03": "Indra and Varuna are most liberal givers of treasure to the men who toil to serve them, When they, as Friends inclined to friendship, honoured with dainty food, delight in flowing Soma.",
   "04.041.04": "Indra and Varuna, ye hurl, O Mighty, on him your strongest flashing bolt of thunder Who treats us ill, the robber and oppressor: measure on him your overwhelming vigour.",
   "04.041.05": "O Indra-Varuna, be ye the lovers of this my song, as steers who love the milch-Cow. Milk may it yield us as, gone forth to pasture, the great Cow pouring out her thousand rivers.",
   "04.041.06": "For fertile fields, for worthy sons and grandsons, for the Sun's beauty and for steer-like vigour, May Indra-Varuna with gracious favours work marvels for us in the stress of battle.",

   "05.030.04": "Indra, when born, thou madest firm thy spirit: alone thou seekest war to fight with many. With might thou clavest e'en the rock asunder, and foundest out the stable of the Milch-kine.",
   "05.030.05": "When thou wast born supremest at a distance, bearing a name renowned in far-off regions, Since then e'en Gods have been afraid of Indra: he conquered all the floods which served the Dasa.",

   "05.031.04": "Anus have wrought a chariot for thy Courser, and Tvastar, Much-invoked! thy bolt that glitters. The Brahmans with their songs exalting Indra increased his strength that he might slaughter Ahi.",
   "05.031.05": "When heroes sang their laud to thee the Hero, Indra! and stones and Aditi accordant, Without or steed or chariot were the fellies which, sped by Indra, rolled upon the Dasytis.",
   "05.031.06": "I will declare thine exploits wrought aforetime, and, Maghavan, thy deeds of late achievement, When, Lord of Might, thou sunderedst earth and heaven, winning for man the moistly-gleaming waters.",
   "05.031.07": "This is thy deed, e'en this, Wonderful! Singer! that, slaying Ahi, here thy strength thou showedst, Didst check and stay e'en gusna's wiles and magic, and, drawing nigh, didst chase away the Dasytis.",
   "05.031.08": "Thou, Indra, on the farther bank forYadu and Turvaga didst stay the gushing waters. Ye both assailed the fierce: thou barest Kutsa: when Gods and Usana came to you together.",
   "05.031.09": "Let the steeds bring you both, Indra and Kutsa, borne on the chariot within hearing-distance. Ye blew him from the waters, from his dwelling, and chased the darkness from the noble's spirit.",
   "05.031.10": "Even this sage hath come looking for succour even to Vata's docile harnessed horses. Here are the Maruts, all, thy dear companions: prayers have increased thy power and might, O Indra.",

   "05.032.02": "The fountain-depths obstructed in their seasons, thou, Thunderer! madest flow, the mountain's udder. Strong Indra, thou by slaying e'en the Dragon that lay extended there hast shown thy vigour.",
   "05.032.03": "Indra with violence smote down the weapon, yea, even of that wild and mighty creature. Although he deemed himself alone unequalled, another had been born e'en yet more potent.",
   "05.032.04": "Him, whom the heavenly food of these delighted, child of the mist, strong waxing, couched in darkness, Him the bolt-hurling Thunderer with his lightning smote down and slew, the Danava's wrath-fire, Susna.",
   "05.032.05": "Though he might ne'er be wounded still his vitals felt that, the God's bolt, which his powers supported, When, after offered draughts, Strong Lord, thou laidest him, fain to battle, in the pit in darkness.",

   "05.032.09": "Who may arrest his strength or cheek his vigour? Alone, resistless, he bears off all riches. Even these Twain, these Goddesses, through terror of Indra's might, retire from his dominion.",
   "05.032.10": "E'en the Celestial Axe bows down before him, and the Earth, lover-like, gives way to Indra. As he imparts all vigour to these people, straightway the folk bend them to him the Godlike.",

   "05.032.12": "So, too, I hear of thee as in due season urging to action and enriching singers. What have thy friends received from thee, the Brahmans who, faithful, rest their hopes on thee, O Indra?",
   "05.033.01": "GREAT praise to Indra, great and strong mid heroes, I ponder thus, the feeble to the Mighty, Who with his band shows favour to this people, when lauded, in the fight where spoil is gathered.",
   "05.033.02": "So made attentive by our hymns, Steer! Indra! thou fastenedst the girth of thy Bay Coursers, Which, Maghavan, at thy will thou drivest hither. With these subdue for us the men who hate us.",
   "05.033.03": "They were not turned to us-wtrd, lofty Indra! while yet through lack of prayer they stood unharnessed. Ascend this chariot, thou whose hand wields thunder, and draw the rein, O Lord of noble horses.",
   "05.033.04": "Thou, because many lauds are thine, O Indra, wast active warring in the fields for cattle. For Surya in his own abode thou, Hero, formedst in fights even a Dasa's nature.",
   "05.033.05": "Thine are we, Indra; thine are all these people, conscious of might, whose cars are set in motion. Some hero come to us, O Strong as Ahi beauteous in war, to be invoked like Bhaga.",
   "05.033.06": "Strength much to be desired is in thee, Indra: the Immortal dances forth his hero exploits. Such, Lord of Treasure, give us splendid riches. I praise the Friend's gift, his whose wealth is mighty.",
   "05.033.07": "Thus favour us, O Indra, with ihy succour; Hero, protect the bards who sing thy praises. Be friendly in the fray to those who offer the skin of beautiful and well-pressed Soma.",
   "05.033.08": "And these ten steeds which Trasadasyu gives me, the goldrich chief, the son of Purukutsa, Resplendent in their brightness shall convey me. Gairiksita willed it and so came I hither.",
   "05.033.09": "And these, bestowed as sacrificial guerdon, the powerful tawny steeds of Marutasva; And thousands which kind Cyavatana gave me, abundantly bestowed for my adornment.",
   "05.033.10": "And these commended horses, bright and active, by Dhvanya son of Laksmana presented, Came unto me, as cows into the Rsi Samvarana's stall, with magnitude of riches.",

   "05.034.02": "He who filled full his belly with the Soma's juice, Maghavan, was delighted with the meath's sweet draught, When Usana, that he might slay the monstrous beast, gave him the mighty weapon with a thousand points.",
   "05.034.03": "Illustrious is the man whoever presseth out Soma for him in sunshine or in cloud and rain. The mighty Maghavan who is the sage's Friend advanceth more and more his beauteous progeny.",
   "05.034.04": "The Strong God doth not flee away from him whose sire, whose mother or whose brother he hath done to death. He, the Avenger, seeketh this man's offered gifts: this God, the source of riches, doth not flee from sin.",
   "05.034.05": "He seeks no enterprise with five or ten to aid, nor stays with him who pours no juice though prospering well. The Shaker conquers or slays in this way or that, and to the pious gives a stable full of kine.",
   "05.034.06": "Exceeding strong in war he stays the chariot wheel, and, hating him who pours not, prospers him who pours. Indra the terrible, tamer of every man, as Arya leads away the Dasa at his will.",
   "05.034.07": "He gathers up for plunder all the niggard's gear: excellent wealth he gives to him who offers gifts. Not even in wide stronghold may all the folk stand firm who have provoked to anger his surpassing might.",
   "05.034.08": "When Indra Maghavan hath marked two wealthy men fighting for beauteous cows with all their followers, He who stirs all things takes one as his close ally, and, Shaker, with his Heroes, sends the kine to him.",
   "05.034.09": "Agni! I laud the liberal Agnivesi, Satri the type and standard of the pious. May the collected waters yield him plenty, and his be powerful and bright dominion.",
   "05.035.01": "INDRA, for our assistance bring that most effectual power of thine, Which conquers men for us, and wins the spoil, invincible in fight.",
   "05.035.02": "Indra, whatever aids be thine, four be they, or, O Hero, three, Or those of the Five Tribes of men, bring quickly all that help to us.",
   "05.035.03": "The aid most excellent of thee the Mightiest hitherward we call, For thou wast born with hero might, conquering, Indra, with the Strong.",
   "05.035.04": "Mighty to prosper us wast thou born, and mighty is the strength thou hast. In native power thy soul is firm: thy valour, Indra, slays a host.",
   "05.035.05": "O Satakratu, Lord of Strength, O Indra, Caster of the Stone. With all thy chariot's force assail the man who shows himself thy foe.",
   "05.035.06": "For, Mightiest Vrtra-slayer, thee, fierce, foremost among many, folk Whose sacred grass is trimmed invite to battle where the spoil is won.",
   "05.035.07": "Indra, do thou protect our car that mingles foremost in the fights, That bears its part in every fray, invincible and seeking spoil.",
   "05.035.08": "Come to us, Indra, and protect our car with thine intelligence. May we, O Mightiest One, obtain excellent fame at break of day, and meditate our hymn at dawn.",

   "05.036.02": "Lord of Bay Horses, Hero, may the Soma rise to thy cheeks and jaws like mountain-ridges. May we, O King, as he who driveth coursers, all joy in thee with hymns, invoked of many!",
   "05.036.03": "Invoked of many, Caster of the Stone my heart quakes like a rolling wheel for fear of penury. Shall not Puruvasu the singer give thee praise, O ever-prospering Maghavan, mounted on thy car?",
   "05.036.04": "Like the press-stone is this thy praiser, Indra. Loudly he lifts his voice with strong endeavour. With thy left hand, O Maghavan, give us riches: with thy right, Lord of Bays, be not reluctant.",
   "05.036.05": "May the strong Heaven make thee the Strong wax stronger: Strong, thou art borne by thy two strong Bay Horses. So, fair of cheek, with mighty chariot, mighty, uphold us, strong-willed, thunderarmed, in battle.",
   "05.036.06": "Maruts, let all the people in obeisance bow down before this youthful Srutaratha, Who, rich in steeds, gave me two dark red horses together with three hundred head of cattle.",
   "05.037.01": "BEDEWED with holy oil and meetly worshipped, the Swift One vies with Surya's beam in splendour. For him may mornings dawn without cessation who saith, Let us press Soma out for Indra.",
   "05.037.02": "With kindled fire and strewn grass let him worship, and, Soma-presser, sing with stones adjusted: And let the priest whose press-stones ring forth loudly, go down with his oblation to the river.",

   "05.037.04": "No troubles vex that King in whose home Indra drinks the sharp Soma juice with milk commingled. With heroes he drives near, he slays the foeman: Blest, cherishing that name, he guards his people.",
   "05.037.05": "May he support in peace and win in battle: he masters both the hosts that meet together. Dear shall he be to Surya, dear to Agni, who with pressed Soma offers gifts to India.",
   "05.038.01": "WIDE, Indra Satakratu, spreads the bounty of thine ample grace: So, Lord of fair dominion, Friend of all men, give us splendid wealth.",
   "05.038.02": "The food which, Mightiest Indra, thou possessest worthy of renown Is bruited as most widely famed, invincible, O Golden-hued!",
   "05.038.03": "O Darter of the Stone, the powers which readily obey thy will,- Divinities, both thou and they, ye rule, to guard them, earth and heaven.",
   "05.038.04": "And from whatever power of thine, O Vrtra-slayer, it may be, Bring thou to us heroic strength: thou hast a man's regard for us.",
   "05.038.05": "In thy protection, with these aids of thine, O Lord of Hundred Powers, Indra, may we be guarded well, Hero, may we be guarded well.",

   "05.040.05": "O Surya, when the Asura's descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness, All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing.",
   "05.040.06": "What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu's magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra, By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Surya concealed in gloom that stayed his function.",

   "07.103.01": "THEY who lay quiet for a year, the Brahmans who fulfil their vows, The Frogs have lifted up their voice, the voice Parjanya hath inspired.",
   "07.103.02": "What time on these, as on a dry skin lying in the pool's bed, the floods of heaven descended, The music of the Frogs comes forth in concert like the cows lowing with their calves beside them.",

   "07.103.09": "They keep the twelve month's God-appointed order, and never do the men neglect the season. Soon as the Rain-time in the year returneth, these who were heated kettles gain their freedom.",
   "07.103.10": "Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat have granted riches, and Green and Spotty have vouchsafed us treasure. The Frogs who give us cows in hundreds lengthen our lives in this most fertilizing season.",
   "07.104.01": "INDRA and Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe, send downward, O ye Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom. Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them away from us, pierce the voracious ones.",
   "07.104.02": "Indra and Soma, let sin round the wicked boil like as a caldron set amid the flames of fire. Against the foe of prayer, devourer of raw flesh, the vile fiend fierce of eye, keep ye perpetual hate.",
   "07.104.03": "Indra and Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them into darkness that hath no support, So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your wrathful might prevail and conquer them.",
   "07.104.04": "Indra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth. Yea, forge out of the mountains your celestial dart wherewith ye burn to death the waxing demon race.",

   "07.104.07": "In your impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy these evil beings, slay the treacherous fiends. Indra and Soma, let the wicked have no bliss who evermore assails us with malignity.",
   "07.104.08": "Whoso accuses me with words of falsehood when I pursue my way with guileless spirit, May he, the speaker of untruth, be, Indra, like water which the hollowed hand compresses.",

   "07.104.10": "The fiend, O Agni, who designs to injure the essence of our food, kine, steeds, or bodies, May he, the adversary, thief, and robber, sink to destruction, both himself and offipring.",
   "07.104.11": "May he be swept away, himself and children: may all the three earths press him down beneath them. May his fair glory, O ye Gods, be blighted, who in the day or night would fain destroy us.",
   "07.104.12": "The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their words oppose each other. Of these two that which is the true and honest, Soma protects, and brings the false to nothing.",
   "07.104.13": "Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims the Warrior's title. He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entangled in the noose of Indra.",
   "07.104.14": "As if I worshipped deities of falsehood, or thought vain thoughts about the Gods, O Agni. Why art thou angry with us, Jatavedas? Destruction fall on those who lie against thee!",
   "07.104.15": "So may I die this day if I have harassed any man's life or if I be a demon. Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue hath called me Yatudhana.",
   "07.104.16": "May Indra slay him with a mi weapon, and let the vilest ofghty all creatures perish, The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon though devoid of demon nature.",
   "07.104.17": "She too who wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body in her guile and malice, May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones with loud ring destroy the demons.",
   "07.104.18": "Spread out, ye Maruts, search among the people: seize ye and grind the Raksasas to pieces, Who fly abroad, transformed to birds, at night-time, or sully and pollute our holy worship.",
   "07.104.19": "Hurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it, Maghavan, made keen by Soma. Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the demons with thy rocky weapon.",
   "07.104.20": "They fly, the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they harm indomitable Indra. Sakra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now, let him cast his bolt at fiendish wizards.",
   "07.104.21": "Indra hath ever been the fiends' destroyer who spoil oblations of the Gods' invokers: Yea, Sakra, like an axe that spilts the timber, attacks and smashes them like earthen vessels.",
   "07.104.22": "Destroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet, destroy him in the form of dog or cuckoo. Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture as with a stone, O Indra, crush the demon.",
   "07.104.23": "Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn drive off the couples of Kimidins. Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble: from grief that comes from heaven mid-air preserve us.",
   "07.104.24": "Slay the male demon, Indra! slay the female, joying and triumphing in arts of magic. Let the fools' gods with bent necks fall and perish, and see no more the Sun when he arises.",

   "08.001.04": "Those skilled in song, O Maghavan among these men o'ercome with might the foeman's songs. Come hither, bring us strength in many a varied form most near that it may succour us.",
   "08.001.05": "O Caster of the Stone, I would not sell thee for a mighty price, Not for a thousand, Thunderer! nor ten thousand, nor a hundred, Lord of countless wealth!",
   "08.001.06": "O Indra, thou art more to me than sire or niggard brother is. Thou and my mother, O Good Lord, appear alike, to give me wealth abundantly.",
   "08.001.07": "Where art thou? Whither art thou gone? For many a place attracts thy mind. Haste, Warrior, Fort-destroyer, Lord of battle's din, haste, holy songs have sounded forth.",

   "08.001.12": "He without ligature, before making incision in the neck, Closed up the wound again, most wealthy Maghavan, who maketh whole the injured part.",
   "08.001.13": "May we be never cast aside, and strangers, as it were, to thee. We, Thunder-wielding Indra, count ourselves as trees rejected and unfit to bum.",
   "08.001.14": "O Vrtra-slayer, we were thought slow and unready for the fray. Yet once in thy great bounty may we have delight, O Hero, after praising thee.",
   "08.001.15": "If he will listen to my laud, then may out Soma-drops that flow Rapidly through the strainer gladden Indra, drops due to the Tugryas' Strengthener.",

   "08.001.23": "Come, Indra, and rejoice thyself, O God, in manifold affluence. Thou fillest like a lake thy vast capacious bulk with Soma and with draughts besides.",
   "08.001.24": "A thousand and a hundred Steeds are harnessed to thy golden car. So may the long-mancd Bays, yoked by devotion, bring Indra to drink the Soma juice.",
   "08.001.25": "Yoked to thy chariot wrought of gold, may thy two Bays with peacock tails, Convey thee hither, Steeds with their white backs, to quaff sweet juice that makes us eloquent.",

   "09.067.26": "Cleanse us, God Savitar, with Three, O Soma, with sublimest forms, Agni, with forms of power and might.",
   "09.067.27": "May the Gods' company make me clean, and Vasus make rue pure by song. Purify me, ye General Gods; O Jatavedas, make me pure.",

   "09.068.03": "The gladdening drink that measured out the meeting Twins fills full with milk the Eternal Everwaxing Pair. Bringing to light the Two great Regions limitless, moving above them he gained sheen that never fades.",

   "09.068.05": "With energetic intellect the Sage is born, deposited as germ of Law, far from the Twins. They being young at first showed visibly distinct the Creature that is half-concealed and halfexposed.",
   "09.068.06": "The sages knew the form of him the Gladdener, what time the Falcon brought the plant from far away. Him who assures success they beautified in streams, the stalk who yearned therefor, mighty and meet for praise.",

   "09.069.09": "These Pavamanas here, these drops of Soma, to Indra have sped forth like cars to booty. Effused, they pass the cleansing fleece, while, gold-hued, they cast their covering off to pour the rain down.",

   "09.070.01": "THE three times seven Milch-kine in the eastern heaven have for this Soma poured the genuine milky draught. Four other beauteous Creatures hath he made for his adornment, when he waxed in strength through holy rites.",
   "09.070.02": "Longing for lovely Amrta, by his wisdom he divided, each apart from other, earth and heaven. He gladly wrapped himself in the most lucid floods, when through their glory they found the God's resting-place.",

   "09.071.02": "Strong, bellowing, he goes, like one who slays the folk; he lets this hue of Asuras flow off from him, Throws off his covering, seeks his father's meeting-place, and thus makes for himself the bright robe he assumes.",
   "09.071.03": "Onward he flows, from both the hands, pressed out with stones: excited by the prayer, the water makes him wild. He frolics and draws near, completes his work with song, and bathes in streams to satisfy the worshipper.",
   "09.071.04": "They pour out meath around the Master of the house, Celestial Strengthener of the mountain that gives might; In whom, through his great powers, oblation-eating cows in their uplifted udder mix their choicest milk.",
   "09.071.05": "They, the ten sisters, on the lap of Aditi, have sent him forward like a car from both the arms. He wanders and comes near the Cow's mysterious place, even the place which his inventions have produced.",
   "09.071.06": "Like as a falcon to his home, so speeds the God to his own golden wisely-tashioned place to rest. With song they urge the darling to the sacred grass: the Holy One goes like a courser to the Gods.",
   "09.071.07": "From far away, from heaven, the redhued noted Sage, Steer of the triple height, hath sung unto the kine. With thousand guidings he, leading this way and that, shines, as a singer, splendidly through many a morn.",
   "09.071.08": "His covering assumes a radiant hue; where'er he comes into the fight he drives the foe afar. The Winner of the Floods, with food he seeks the host of heaven, he comes to praises glorified with milk.",

   "09.072.01": "THEY cleanse the Gold-hued: like a red Steed is he yoked, and Soma in the jar is mingled with the milk. He sendeth out his voice, and many loving friends of him the highly lauded hasten with their songs.",
   "09.072.02": "The many sages utter words in unison, while into Indra's throat they pour the Soma juice, When, with the ten that dwell together closely joined, the men whose hands are skilful cleanse the lovely meath.",
   "09.072.03": "He goes upon his way, unresting, to the cows, over the roaring sound which Sarya's Daughter loves. The Falcon brought it to him for his own delight: now with the twofold kindred sisters is his home.",

   "09.073.04": "Sweet-tongued, exhaustless, they have sent their voices down togetlier, in heaven's vault that pours a thousand streams. His wildly-restless warders never close an eye: in every place are found the bonds that bind man last.",
   "09.073.05": "O'er Sire and Mother they have roared in unison bright with the verse of praise, burning up riteless men, Blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the swarthy skin which Indra hates.",
   "09.073.06": "Those which, as guides of song and counsellors of speed, were manifested from their ancient dwelling place,- From these the eyeless and the deaf have turned aside: the wicked travel not the pathway of the Law.",
   "09.073.07": "What time the filter with a thousand streams is stretched, the thoughtful sages purify their song therein. Bright-coloured are their spies, vigorous, void of guile, excellent, fair to see, beholders of mankind.",

   "09.073.09": "The thread of sacrifice spun in the cleansing sieve, on Varuna's tongue-tip, by supernatural might,- This, by their striving, have the prudent ones attained: he who hath not this power shall sink into the pit.",
   "09.074.01": "BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the Red, the Strong, would win the light of heaven. He comes with heavenly seed that makes the water swell: him for wide-spreading shelter we implore with prayer.",
   "09.074.02": "A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way. He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move! together and all food.",
   "09.074.03": "Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty, well-made food, meath blent with Soma juice; He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud.",

   "09.076.04": "Onward he flows, the King of all that sees the light: the Rsis' Lord hath raised the song of sacrifice; Even he who is adorned with Surya's arrowy beam, Father of hymns, whose wisdom is beyond our reach.",
   "09.076.05": "Like as a bull to herds, thou flowest to the pail, bellowing as a steer upon the water's lap. So, best of Cheerers, thou for Indra flowest on that we, with thy protection, may o'ercome in fight.",
   "09.077.01": "MORE beauteous than the beautiful, as Indra's bolt, this Soma, rich in sweets, hath clamoured in the vat. Dropping with oil, abundant, streams of sacrifice flow unto him like milch-kine, lowing, with their milk.",

   "10.024.05": "When the united pair were rent asunder all the Gods complained. The Gods to the Nasatyas cried, Bring these together once again.",
   "10.024.06": "Sweet be my going forth, and rich in sweets be my approach to home. So, through your Deity, both Gods, enrich us with all pleasantness.",
   "10.025.01": "SEND us a good and happy mind, send energy and mental power. Then-at your glad carouse-let men joy in thy love, Sweet juice! as kine in pasture. Thou. art waxing great.",

   "10.027.01": "THIS, singer, is my firm determination, to aid the worshipper who pours the Soma. I slay the man who brings no milkoblation, unrighteous, powerful, the truth's perverter.",
   "10.027.02": "Then Will I, when I lead my friends to battle against the radiant persons of the godless, Prepare for thee at home a vigorous bullock, and pour for thee the fifteen-fold strong juices.",
   "10.027.03": "I know not him who sayeth and declareth that he hath slain the godless in the battle. Soon as they see the furious combat raging, men speak forth praises of my vigorous horses.",
   "10.027.04": "While yet my deeds of might were unrecorded, all passed for Maghavans though I existed. The potent one who dwelt in peace I conquered, grasped by the foot and slew him on the mountain.",
   "10.027.05": "None hinder me in mine heroic exploits, no, not the mountains when I will and purpose. Even the deaf will tremble at my roaring, and every day will dust be agitated.",
   "10.027.06": "To see the Indraless oblation-drinkers, mean offerers, o'ertaken by destruction! Then shall the fellies of my car pass over those who have blamed my joyous Friend and scorned him.",
   "10.027.07": "Thou wast, thou grewest to full vital vigour: an earlier saw, a later one shall see thee. Two canopies, as 'twere, are round about him who reacheth to the limit of this region.",
   "10.027.08": "The freed kine eat the barley of the pious. 1 saw them as they wandered with the herdsman. The calling of the pious rang around them. What portion will these kine afford their owner?",
   "10.027.09": "When we who cat the grass of men are gathered I am with barley-eaters in the corn-land. There shall the captor yoke the yokeless bullock, and he who hath been yoked seek one to loose him.",
   "10.027.10": "There wilt thou hold as true my spoken purpose, to bring together quadrupeds. and bipeds. I will divide, without a fight, his riches who warreth here, against the Bull, with women.",

   "10.027.14": "High, leafless, shadowless, and swift is Heaven: the Mother stands, the Youngling, loosed, is feeding. Loud hath she lowed, licking Another's offspring. In what world hath the Cow laid down her udder?",
   "10.027.15": "Seven heroes from the nether part ascended, and from the upper part came eight together. Nine from behind came armed with winnowing-baskets: ten from the front pressed o'er the rock's high ridges.",
   "10.027.16": "One of the ten, the tawny, shared in common, they send to execute their final purpose. The Mother carries on her breast the Infant of noble form and soothes it while it knows not.",
   "10.027.17": "The Heroes dressed with fire the fatted wether: the dice were thrown by way of sport and gaming. Two reach the plain amid the heavenly waters, hallowing and with means of purifying.",
   "10.027.18": "Crying aloud they ran in all directions: One half of them will cook, and not the other. To me hath Savitar, this God, declared it: He will perform, whose food is wood and butter.",
   "10.027.19": "I saw a troop advancing from the distance moved, not by wheels but their own God-like nature. The Friendly One seeks human generations, destroying, still new bands of evil beings.",
   "10.027.20": "These my two Bulls, even Pramara's, are harnessed: drive them not far; here let them often linger. The waters even shall aid him to his object, and the all-cleansing Sun who is above us.",
   "10.027.21": "This is the thunderbolt which often whirleth down from the lofty misty realm of Surya. Beyond this realm there is another glory so through old age they pass and feel no sorrow.",
   "10.027.22": "Bound fast to,every tree the cow is lowing, and thence the man-consuming birds are flying, Then all this world, though pressing juice for Indra and strengthening the Rsi, is affrighted.",
   "10.027.23": "In the Gods' mansion stood the first-created, and from their separation came the later. Three warm the Earth while holding stores of water, and Two of these convey the murmuring moisture.",
   "10.027.24": "This is thy life: and do thou mark and know it. As such, hide not thyself in time of battle. He manifests the light and hides the vapour: his foot is never free from robes that veil it.",
   "10.028.01": "Now all my other friends are here assembled: my Sire-in-law alone hath not come hither. So might he eat the grain and drink the Soma, and, satisfied, return unto; his dwelling.",
   "10.028.02": "Loud belloweth the Bull whose horns are sharpened: upon the height above earth's breadth he standeth. That man I guard and save in all his troubles who fills my flanks when he hath shed the Soma.",
   "10.028.03": "Men with the stone press out for thee, O Indra, strong, gladdening Soma, and thereof thou drinkest. Bulls they dress for thee, and of these thou eatest when, Maghavan, with food thou art invited.",
   "10.028.04": "Resolve for me, O singer, this my riddle: The rivers send their swelling water backward: The fox steals up to the approaching lion: the jackal drives the wild-boar from the brushwood.",
   "10.028.05": "How shall I solve this riddle, I, the simple, declare the thought of thee the Wise and Mighty? Tell us, well knowing, as befits the season: Whitherward is thy prosperous car advancing?",
   "10.028.06": "Thus do they magnify me, me the mighty higher than even high heaven is my car-pole. I all at once demolish many thousands: my Sire begot me with no foe to match me.",
   "10.028.07": "Yea, and the Gods have known me also, Indra, as mighty, fierce and strong in every exploit. Exulting with the bolt I slaughtered Vrtra, and for the offerer oped with might the cow-stall.",
   "10.028.08": "The Deities approached, they carried axes; splitting the wood they came with their attendants. They laid good timber in the fire-receivers, and burnt the grass up where they found it growing.",
   "10.028.09": "The hare hath swallowed up the opposing razor: I sundered with a clod the distant mountain. The great will I make subject to the little: the calf shall wax in strength and cat the bullock.",
   "10.028.10": "There hath the strong-winged eagle left his talon, as a snared lion leaves the trap that caught him. Even the wild steer in his thirst is captured: the leather strap still holds his foot entangled.",
   "10.028.11": "So may the leather strap their foot entangle who fatten on the viands of the Brahman. They all devour the bulls set free to wander, while they themselves destroy their bodies' vigour.",
   "10.028.12": "They were well occupied with holy duties who sped in person with their lauds to Soma. Speaking like man, mete to us wealth and booty: in heaven thou hast the name and fame of Hero.",
   "10.029.01": "As sits the young bird on the tree rejoicing, ye, swift Pair, have been roused by clear laudation, Whose Herald-Priest through many days is Indra, earth's Guardian, Friend of men, the best of Heroes.",
   "10.029.02": "May we, when this Dawn and the next dance hither, be thy best servants, most heroic Hero! Let the victorious car with triple splendour bring hitherward the hundred chiefs with Kutsa.",
   "10.029.03": "What was the gladdening draught that pleased thee, Indra? Speed through our doors to songs, for thou art mighty. Why comest thou to me, what gift attracts thee? Fain would I bring thee food most meet to offer.",
   "10.029.04": "Indra, what fame hath one like thee mid heroes? With what plan wilt thou act? Why hast thou sought us? As a true Friend, Wide-Strider! to sustain us, since food absorbs the thought of each among us.",
   "10.029.05": "Speed happily those, as Surya ends his journey, who meet his wish as bridegrooms meet their spouses; Men who present, O Indra strong by nature, with food the many songs that tell thy praises.",
   "10.029.06": "Thine are two measures, Indra, wide-wellmeted, heaven for thy majesty, earth for thy wisdom. Here for thy choice are Somas mixed with butter: may the sweet meath be pleasant for thy drinking.",
   "10.029.07": "They have poured out a bowl to him, to Indra, full of sweet juice, for faithful is his bounty. O'er earth's expanse hath he grown great by wisdom, the Friend of man, and by heroic exploits.",
   "10.029.08": "Indra hath conquered in his wars, the Mighty: men strive in multitudes to win his friendship. Ascend thy chariot as it were in battle, which thou shalt drive to us with gracious favour.",
   "10.030.01": "As 'twere with swift exertion of the spirit, let the priest speed to the celestial Waters, The glorious food of Varuna and Mitra. To him who spreadeth far this laud I offer.",
   "10.030.02": "Adhvaryus, he ye ready with oblations,, and come with longing to the longing Waters, Down on which looks the. purple-tinted Eagle. Pour ye that flowing wave this day, deft-handed.",
   "10.030.03": "Go to the reservoir, O ye Adhvaryus worship the Waters' Child with your oblations. A consecrated wave he now will give you, so press for him the Soma rich in sweetness.",
   "10.030.04": "He who shines bright in floods, unfed with fuel, whom sages worship at their sacrifices: Give waters rich in sweets, Child of the Waters, even those which gave heroic might to Indra:",
   "10.030.05": "Those in which Soma joys and is delighted, as a young man with fair and pleasant damsels. Go thou unto those Waters, O Adhvaryu, and purify with herbs what thou infusest.",
   "10.030.06": "So maidens bow before the youthful gallant who comes with love to them who yearn to meet him. In heart accordant and in wish one-minded are the Adhvaryus and the heavenly Waters.",
   "10.030.07": "He who made room for you when fast imprisoned, who freed you from the mighty imprecation,- Even to that Indra send the meath-rich current, the wave that gratifies the Gods, O Waters.",
   "10.030.08": "Send forth to him the meath-rich wave, O Rivers, which is your offspring and a well of sweetness, Oil-balmed, to be implored at sacrifices. Ye wealthy Waters, hear mine invocation.",
   "10.030.09": "Send forth the rapture-giving wave, O Rivers, which Indra drinks, which sets the Twain in motion; The well that springeth from the clouds, desirous, that wandereth triple-formed, distilling transport.",
   "10.030.10": "These winding Streams which with their double current, like cattle-raiders, seek the lower pastures,- Waters which dwell together, thrive together, Queens, Mothers of the world, these, Rsi, honour.",
   "10.030.11": "Send forth our sacrifice with holy worship send forth the hymn and prayer for gain of riches. For need of sacrifice disclose the udder. Give gracious hearing to our call, O Waters.",
   "10.030.12": "For, wealthy Waters, ye control all treasures: ye bring auspicious intellect and Amrta. Ye are the Queens of independent riches Sarasvati give full life to the singer!",
   "10.030.13": "When I behold the Waters coming hither, carrying with them milk and mcath and butter, Bearing the well-pressed Soma juice to Indra, they harmonize in spirit with Adhvaryus.",
   "10.030.14": "Rich, they are come with wealth for living beings, O friends, Adhvaryus, seat them in their places. Seat them on holy grass, ye Soma-bringers in harmony with the Offspring of the Waters.",
   "10.030.15": "Now to this grass are come the longing Waters: the Pious Ones are seated at our worship. Adbvaryus, press the Soma juice for Indra so will the service of the Gods be easy.",
   "10.031.01": "MAY benediction of the Gods approach us, holy, to aid us with all rapid succours. Therewith may we be happily befriended, and pass triumphant over all our troubles.",
   "10.031.02": "A man should think on wealth and strive to win it by adoration on the path of Order, Counsel himself with his own mental insight, and grasp still nobler vigour with his spirit.",
   "10.031.03": "The hymn is formed, poured are the allotted portions: as to a ford friends come unto the Wondrous. We have obtained the power of case and comfort, we haVe become acquainted, with Immortals.",
   "10.031.04": "Pleased be the Eternal Lord who loves the household with this man whom God Savitar created. May Bhaga Aryaman grace him with cattle: may he appear to him, and be, delightful.",
   "10.031.05": "Like the Dawns' dwelling-place be this assembly, where in their might men rich in food have gathered. Striving to share the praises of this singer. To us come strengthening and effectual riches!",
   "10.031.06": "This Bull's most gracious far-extended favour existed first of all in full abundance. By his support they are maintained in common who in the Asura's mansion dwell together.",
   "10.031.07": "What was the tree, what wood, in sooth, produced it, from which they fashioned forth the Earth and Heaven? These Twain stand fast and wax not old for ever: these have sung praise to many a day and morning.",
   "10.031.08": "Not only here is this: more is beyond us. He is the Bull, the Heaven's and Earth's supporter. With power divine he makes his skin a filter, when the Bay Coursers bear him on as Surya.",
   "10.031.09": "He passes o'er the broad earth like a Stega: he penetrates the world as Wind the mist-cloud. He, balmed with oil, near Varuna and Mitra, like Agni in the wood, hath shot forth splendour.",
   "10.031.10": "When suddenly called the cow that erst was barren, she, self-protected, ended all her troubles. Earth, when the first son sprang from sire and mother, cast up the gami, that which men were seeking.",
   "10.031.11": "To Nrsad's son they gave the name of Kainva, and he the brown-hued courser won the treasure. For him dark-coloured streamed the shining udder: none made it swell for him. Thus Order willed it.",
   "10.032.01": "FORTH speed the Pair to bring the meditating God, benevolent with boons sent in return for boons. May Indra graciously accept both gifts from us, when he hath knowledge of the flowing Soma juice.",
   "10.032.02": "Thou wanderest far, O Indra, through the spheres of light and realms of earth, the region, thou whom many praise! Let those who often bring their solemn rites conquer the noisy babblers who present no gifts.",
   "10.032.03": "More beautiful than beauty must this seem to me, when the son duly careth for his parents' line. The wife attracts the husband: with a shout of joy the man's auspicious marriage is performed aright.",
   "10.032.04": "This beauteous place of meeting have I looked upon, where, like milch-cows, the kine order the marriage train; Where the Herd's Mother counts as first and best of all, and round her are the seven-toned people of the choir.",
   "10.032.05": "The Pious One hath reached your place before the rest: One only moves victorious with the Rudras' band. To these your helpers pour our meath, Immortal Gods, with whom your song of praise hath power to win their gifts.",
   "10.032.06": "He who maintains the Laws of God informed me that thou wast lying hidden in the waters. Indra, who knoweth well, beheld and showed thee. By him instructed am I come, O Agni.",
   "10.032.07": "The stranger asks the way of him who knows it: taught by the skilful guide he travels onward. This is, in truth, the blessing of instruction: he finds the path that leads directly forward.",
   "10.032.08": "Even now he breathed: these days hath he remembered. Concealed, he sucked the bosom of his Mother. Yet in his youth old age hath come upon him: he hath grown gracious, good, and free from anger.",
   "10.032.09": "O Kalasa, all these blessings will we bring them, O Kurusravana, who give rich presents. May he, O wealthy princes, and this Soma which I am bearing in my heart, reward you.",
   "10.033.01": "THE urgings of the people have impelled me, and by,the nearest way I bring you Pusan. The Universal Gods have brought me safely. The cry was heard, Behold, Dubsasu cometh!",
   "10.033.02": "The ribs that compass me give pain and trouble me like rival wives. Indigence, nakedness, exhaustion press me sore: my mind is fluttering like a bird's.",
   "10.033.03": "As rats eat weavers' threads, cares are consuming me, thy singer, gatakratu, me. Have mercy on us once, O Indra, Bounteous Lord: be thou a Father unto us.",
   "10.033.04": "I the priests' Rsi chose as prince most liberal Kurusravana, The son of Trasadasyu's son,",
   "10.033.05": "Whose three bays harnessed to the car bear me straight onward: I will laud The giver of a thousand meeds,",
   "10.033.06": "The sire of Upamasravas, even him whose words were passing sweet, As a fair field is to its lord.",
   "10.033.07": "Mark, Upamasravas, his son, mark, grandson of Mitratithi: I am thy father's eulogist.",
   "10.033.08": "If I controlled Immortal Gods, yea, even were I Lord of men, My liberal prince were living still.",

   "10.034.01": "SPRUNG from tall trees on windy heights, these rollers transport me as they turn upon the table. Dearer to me the die that never slumbers than the deep draught of Mujavan's own Soma.",
   "10.034.02": "She never vexed me nor was angry with me, but to my friends and me was ever gracious. For the die's sake, whose single point is final, mine own devoted wife I alienated.",
   "10.034.03": "My wife holds me aloof, her mother hates me: the wretched man finds none to give him comfort. As of a costly horse grown old and feeble, I find not any profit of the gamester.",
   "10.034.04": "Others caress the wife of him whose riches the die hath coveted, that rapid courser: Of him speak father, mother, brothers saying, We know him not: bind him and take him with you.",
   "10.034.05": "When I resolve to play with these no longer, my friends depart from me and leave me lonely. When the brown dice, thrown on the board, have rattled, like a fond girl I seek the place of meeting.",
   "10.034.06": "The gamester seeks the gambling-house, and wonders, his body all afire, Shall I be lucky? Still do the dice extend his eager longing, staking his gains against his adversary.",
   "10.034.07": "Dice, verily, are armed with goads and driving-hooks, deceiving and tormenting, causing grievous woe. They give frail gifts and then destroy the man who wins, thickly anointed with the player's fairest good.",
   "10.034.08": "Merrily sports their troop, the three-and-fifty, like Savitar the God whose ways are faithful. They bend not even to the mighty's anger: the King himself pays homage and reveres them.",
   "10.034.09": "Downward they roll, and then spring quickly upward, and, handless, force the man with hands to serve them. Cast on the board, like lumps of magic charcoal, though cold themselves they bum the heart to ashes.",
   "10.034.10": "The gambler's wife is left forlorn and wretched: the mother mourns the son who wanders homeless. In constant fear, in debt, and seeking riches, he goes by night unto the home of others.",
   "10.034.11": "Sad is the gambler when he sees a matron, another's wife, and his well-ordered dwelling. He yokes the brown steeds in the early morning, and when the fire is cold sinks down an outcast.",
   "10.034.12": "To the great captain of your mighty army, who hath become the host's imperial leader, To him I show my ten extended fingers: I speak the truth. No wealth am I withholding.",
   "10.034.13": "Play not with dice: no, cultivate thy corn-land. Enjoy the gain, and deem that wealth sufficient. There are thy cattle there thy wife, O gambler. So this good Savitar himself hath told me.",
   "10.034.14": "Make me your friend: show us some little mercy. Assail us not with your terrific fierceness. Appeased be your malignity and anger, and let the brown dice snare some other captive.",
   "10.035.01": "THESE fires associate with Indra are awake, bringing their light when first the Dawn begins to shine. May Heaven and Earth, great Pair, observe our holy work. We claim for us this day the favour of the Gods.",
   "10.035.02": "Yea, for ourselves we claim the grace of Heaven and Earth, of Saryanavan, of the Hills and Mother Streams. For innocence we pray to Surya and to Dawn. So may the flowing Soma bring us bliss to-day.",

   "10.043.07": "When Soma streams together unto Indra flow like waters to the river, rivulets to the lake, In place of sacrifice sages exalt his might, as the rain swells the corn by moisture sent from heaven.",
   "10.043.08": "He rushes through the region like a furious Bull, he who hath made these floods the dames of worthy lords. This Maghavan hath found light for the man who brings oblation, sheds the juice, and promptly pours his gifts.",
   "10.043.09": "Let the keen axe come forth together with the light: here be,.as erst, the teeming cow of sacrifice. Let the Red God shine bright with his refulgent ray, and let the Lord of heroes glow like heaven's clear sheen.",

   "10.044.03": "Let strong and mighty Steeds who bear this Mighty Indra, the Lord of men, whose arm wields thunder, Bring unto us, as sharers of our banquet, the Steer of conquering might, of real vigour.",
   "10.044.04": "So like a Bull thou rushest to the Lord who loves the trough, the Sage, the prop of vigour, in the vat, Prepare thine energies, collect them in thyself: be for our profit as the Master of the wise.",
   "10.044.05": "May precious treasures come to us-so will I pray. Come to the votary's gift offered with beauteous laud. Thou art the Lord, as such sit on this holy grass: thy vessels are inviolate as Law commands.",
   "10.044.06": "Far went our earlist invocation of the Gods, and won us glories that can never be surpassed. They who could not ascend the ship of sacrifice, sink down in desolation, trembling with alarm.",
   "10.044.07": "So be the others, evil-hearted, far away, whose horses, difficult to harness, have been yoked. Here in advance men stand anear to offer gifts, by whom full many a work that brings reward is done.",
   "10.044.08": "He firmly fixed the plains and mountains as they shook. Dyaus thundered forth and made the air's mid-region quake. He stays apart the two confronting bowls; he sings lauds in the potent Soma's joy when he hath drunk.",
   "10.044.09": "I bear this deftly-fashioned goad of thine, wherewith thou, Maghavan, shalt break the strikers with the hoof. At this libation mayst thou be well satisfied. Partake the juice, partake the worship, Maghavan.",
   "10.044.10": "O Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with store of grain and cattle. May we allied, as first in rank, with princes obtain possessions by our own exertion.",

   "10.045.02": "Agni, we know thy three powers in three stations, we know thy forms in many a place divided. We know what name supreme thou hast in secret: we know the source from which thou hast proceeded.",
   "10.045.03": "The Manly-souled lit thee in sea and waters, man's Viewer lit thee in the breast of heaven, There as thou stoodest in the third high region the Steers increased thee in the water's bosom.",
   "10.045.04": "Agni roared out, like Dyaus what time he thunders: he licked the ground about the plants he flickered. At once, when born, he looked around enkindled, and lightened heaven and earth within with splendour.",

   "10.045.11": "While, Agni, day by day men pay thee worship they win themselves all treasures worth the wishing. Allied with thee, eager and craving riches, they have disclosed the stable filled with cattle.",
   "10.045.12": "Agni, the Friend of men, the Soma's keeper, Vaisvanara, hath been lauded by the Rsis. We will invoke benignant Earth and Heaven: ye Deities, give us wealth with hero children.",

   "10.047.08": "Grant us the boon for which I pray, O Indra, a spacious home unmatched among the people. To this may Heaven and Earth accord approval: vouchsafe us mighty and resplendent riches.",
   "10.048.01": "I WAS the first possessor of all precious gear: the wealth of every man I win and gather up. On me as on a Father living creatures call; I deal enjoyment to tho. man who offers gifts.",
   "10.048.02": "I, Indra, am Atharvan's stay and firm support: I brought forth kine to Trita from the Dragon's grasp. I stripped the Dasyus of their manly might, and gave the cattle-stalls to Matarigvan and Dadhyac.",
   "10.048.03": "For me hath Tvastar forged the iron thunderbolt: in me the Gods have centred intellectual power. My sheen is like the Sun's insufferably bright: men honour me as Lord for past and future deeds.",
   "10.048.04": "I won myself these herdi of cattle, steeds and kine, and gold in ample store, with my destructive bolt. I give full many a thousand to the worshipper, what time the Somas and the lauds have made me glad.",
   "10.048.05": "Indra am I none ever wins my wealth from me never at any time am I a thrall to death. Pressing the Soma, ask riches from me alone: ye, Purus, in my friendship shall not suffer harm.",
   "10.048.06": "These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray, The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the God speaks to his worshippers. This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me? Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?",
   "10.048.08": "Against the Gungus I made Atithigva strong, and kept him mid the folk like Vrtra-conquering strength, When I won glory in the great foe-slaying fight, in battle where Karanja fell, and Parnaya.",
   "10.048.09": "With food for mine enjoyment Sapya Nami came: he joined me as a friend of old in search of kine. As I bestowed on him an arrow for the fight I made him worthy of the song apd hymn of praise.",

   "10.048.11": "I, as a God, ne'er violate the statutes of Gods, of Vasus, Rudriyas, Adityas. These Gods have formed me for auspicious vigour, unconquered and invincible for ever.",
   "10.049.01": "I HAVE enriched the singer with surpassing wealth; I have allowed the holy hymn to strengthen me. I, furtherer of him who offers sacrifice, have conquered in each fight the men who worship not.",
   "10.049.02": "The People of the heavens, the waters, and the earth have stablished me among the Gods with Indra's name. I took unto myself the two swift vigorous Bays that speed on divers paths, and the fierce bolt for strength.",
   "10.049.03": "With deadly blows I smote Atka for Kavi's sake; I guarded Kutsa well with these saving helps. As Susna's slayer I brandished the dart of death: I gave not up the Aryan name to Dasyu foes.",
   "10.049.04": "Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus I gave as prey to Kutsa, father-like, to succour him. I was a worthy King to rule the worshipper, when I gave Tuji dear inviolable gifts.",
   "10.049.05": "I gave up Mrgaya to Srutarvan as his prey because he ever followed me and kept my laws. For Ayu's sake I caused Veta to bend and bow, and into Savya's hand delivered Padgrbhi.",
   "10.049.06": "1, I crushed Navavastva of the lofty car, the Dasa, as the Vrtra-slayer kills the fiends; When straightway on the region's farthest edge I brought the God who makes the lights to broaden and increase.",
   "10.049.07": "I travel round about borne onward in my might by the fleet-footed dappled Horses of the Sun. When man's libation calls me to the robe of state I soon repel the powerful Dasyu with my blows.",

   "10.049.11": "Even thus hath Indra Maghavan, truly bounteous, sped Gods and men with mighty operation. The pious glorify all these thine exploits, Lord of Bay Coursers, Strong, and Selfresplendent.",

   "10.050.02": "He with his friend is active, lauded, good to man, Indra who must be glorified by one like me. Hero, Lord of the brave, all cars are thy delight, warring with Vrtra, or for waters, or for spoil.",
   "10.050.03": "Who are the men whom thou wilt further, Indra, who strive to win thy bliss allied with riches? Who urged thee forward to exert thy power divine, to valour, in the war for waters on their fields?",
   "10.050.04": "Thou, Indra, through the holy prayer art mighty, worthy of sacrifice at all libations. In every fight thou castest heroes on the ground: thou art the noblest song, O Lord of all the folk.",
   "10.050.05": "Help now, as Highest, those who toil at sacrifice: well do the people know thy great protecting might. Thou shalt be Everlasing, Giver of success yea, on all these libations thou bestowest strength.",
   "10.050.06": "All these libations thou makest effectual, of which thou art thyself supporter, Son of Power. Therefore thy vessel is to be esteemed the best, sacrifice, holy text, prayer, and exalted speech.",
   "10.050.07": "They who with flowing Soma pray to thee, O Sage, to pour on them thy gifts of opulence and wealth, May they come forward, through their spirit, on the path of bliss, in the wild joy of Soma juice effused.",
   "10.051.01": "LARGE was that covering, and firm of texture, folded wherein thou enteredst the waters. One Deity alone, O Jatavedas Agni, saw all thy forms in sundry places.",
   "10.051.02": "What God hath seen me? Who of all their number clearly beheld my forms in many places? Where lie, then, all the sacred logs of Agni that lead him God-ward, Varuna and Mitra?",
   "10.051.03": "In many places, Agni Jatavedas, we sought thee hidden in the plants and waters. Then Yama marked thee, God of wondrous splendour! effulgent from thy tenfold secret dwelling,",
   "10.051.04": "I fled in fear from sacrificial worship, Varuna, lest the Gods should thus engage me. Thus were my forms laid down in many places. This, as my goal, I Agni saw before me.",
   "10.051.05": "Come; man is pious and would fain do worship, he waits prepared: in gloom thou, Agni, dwellest. Make pathways leading God-ward clear and easy, and bear oblations with a kindly spirit.",
   "10.051.06": "This goal mine elder brothers erst selected, as he who drives a car the way to travel. So,Varuna, I fled afar through terror, as flies the wild-bull from an archer's bowstring.",
   "10.051.07": "We give thee life unwasting, Jatavedas, so that, employed, thou never shalt be injured. So, nobly born! shalt thou with kindly spirit bear to the Gods their share of men's oblations.",
   "10.051.08": "Grant me the first oblations and the latter, entire, my forceful shares of holy presents, The soul of plants, the fatness of the waters, and let there be long life, ye Gods, to Agni.",
   "10.051.09": "Thine be the first oblations and the latter, entire, thy forceful shares of holy presents. Let all this sacrifice be thine, O Agni, and let the world's four regions how before thee.",
   "10.052.01": "INSTRUCT me, all ye Gods, how I, elected your Priest, must seat me here, and how address you. Instruct me how to deal to each his portion, and by what ' path to bring you man's oblation.",
   "10.052.02": "I sit as Priest most skilled in sacrificing: the Maruts and all Deities impel me. Asvins, each day yours is the Adhvaryu's duty: Brahman and wood are here: 'tis yours to offer.",
   "10.052.03": "Who is the Priest? Is he the Priest of Yama? On whom is thrust this God-appointed honour? He springs to life each month, each day that passes; so Gods have made him their oblation-bearer.",
   "10.052.04": "The Gods have made me bearer of oblations, who slipped away and passed through many troubles. Wise Agni shall ordain for us the worship, whether five-wayed, threefold, or seven-threaded.",
   "10.052.05": "So will I win you strength and life for ever. O Gods, that I may give you room and freedom. To Indra's arms would I consign the thunder; in all these battles shall he then be victor.",
   "10.052.06": "The Deities three hundred and thirty-nine, have served and honoured Agni, Strewn sacred grass, anointed him with butter, and seated him as Priest, the Gods' Invoker.",
   "10.053.01": "HE hath arrived, he whom we sought with longing, who skilled in sacrifice well knows its courses. Let him discharge his sacrificial duties: let him sit down as Friend who was before Us.",
   "10.053.02": "Best Priest, he hath been won by being seated, for he hath looked on the well-ordered viands. Come, let usworship Gods who must be worshipped, and pouring oil, laud those who should be lauded.",
   "10.053.03": "Now hath he made the feast of Gods effective: now have we found the secret tongue of worship. Now hath he come, sweet, robed in vital vigour, and made our calling on the Gods effective.",
   "10.053.04": "This prelude of my speech I now will utter, whereby we Gods may quell our Asura foemen. Eaters of strengthening food who merit worship, O ye Five Tribes, be pleased with mine oblation.",
   "10.053.05": "May the Five Tribes be pleased with mine oblation, and the Cow's Sons and all who merit worship. From earthly trouble may the earth protect us, and air's mid realm from woe that comes from heaven.",
   "10.053.06": "Spinning the thread, follow the region's splendid light: guard thou the path ways well which wisdom hath prepared. Weave ye the knotless labour of the bards who sing: be Manu thou, and bring the Heavenly People forth.",
   "10.053.07": "Lovers of Soma, bind the chariot traces fast: set ye the reins in order and embellish them. Bring hitherward the car with seats where eight may sit, whereon the Gods have brought the treasure that we love.",
   "10.053.08": "Here flows Asmanvati: hold fast each other, keep yourselves up, and pass, my friends, the river. There let us leave the Powers that brought no profit, and cross the flood to Powers that are auspicious.",
   "10.053.09": "Tvastar, most deft of workmen, knew each magic art, bringing most blessed bowls that hold the drink of Gods. His axe, wrought of good metal, he is sharpening now, wherewith the radiant Brahmanaspati will cut.",
   "10.053.10": "Now, O ye Sapient Ones, make ye the axes sharp wherewith ye fashion bowls to hold the Amrta. Knowing the secret places make ye ready that whereby the Gods have gotten immortality.",
   "10.053.11": "Ye with a secret tongue and dark intention laid the maiden deep within, the calf within the mouth. They evermore are near us with their gracious help: successful is the song that strives for victory.",
   "10.054.01": "I SING thy fame that, Maghavan, through thy Greatness the heavens and earth invoked thee in their terror, Thou, aiding Gods, didst quell the power of Dasas, what time thou holpest many a race, O Indra.",
   "10.054.02": "When thou wast roaming, waxen strong in body, telling thy might, Indra, among the people, All that men called thy battles was illusion: no foe hast thou to-day, nor erst hast found one.",
   "10.054.03": "Who are the Rsis, then, who comprehended before our time the bounds of all thy greatness? For from thy body thou hast generated at the same time the Mother and the Father.",
   "10.054.04": "Thou, Mighty Steer, hast four supremest natures, Asura natures that may ne'er be injured. All these, O Maghavan, thou surely knowest, wherewith thou hast performed thy great achievements.",
   "10.054.05": "Thou hast all treasures in thy sole possession, treasures made manifest and treasures hidden. Defer not thou, O Maghavan, my longing: thou, art Director, Indra, thou art Giver.",

   "10.055.02": "Great is that secret name and far-extending, whereby thou madest all that is and shall be. The Five Tribes whom he loveth well have entered the light he loveth that was made aforetime.",
   "10.055.03": "He filled the heaven and earth and all between them, Gods five times sevenfold in their proper seasons. With four-and-thirty lights he looks around him, lights of one colour though their ways are divers.",
   "10.055.04": "As first among the lights, O Dawn, thou shonest, whereby thou broughtest forth the Stay of Increase, Great art thou, matchless is thine Asura nature, who, high above, art kin to those beneath thee.",
   "10.055.05": "The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber who runs his circling course with many round him. Behold the Gods' high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday to-day is living.",
   "10.055.06": "Strong is the Red Bird in his strength, great Hero, who from of old hath had no nest to dwell in. That which he knows is truth and never idle: he wins and gives the wealth desired of many.",

   "10.072.03": "Existence, in the earliest age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang. Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.",
   "10.072.04": "Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the earth were born. Daksa was born of Aditi, and Aditi was Daksa's Child.",
   "10.072.05": "For Aditi, O Daksa, she who is thy Daughter, was brought forth. After her were the blessed Gods born sharers of immortal life.",
   "10.072.06": "When ye, O Gods, in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood, Thence, as of dancers, from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose.",
   "10.072.07": "When, O ye Gods, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow, Then ye brought Surya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.",
   "10.072.08": "Eight are the Sons of Adid who from her body sprang to life. With seven she went to meet the Gods she cast Martanda far away.",

   "10.073.01": "THOU wast born mighty for victorious valour, exulting, strongest, full of pride and courage. There, even there, the Maruts strengthened Indra when. his most rapid Mother stirred the Hero.",
   "10.073.02": "There with fiend's ways e'en Prsni was seated: with much laudation they exalted Indra. As if encompassed by the Mighty-footed, from darkness, near at hand, forth came the Children.",
   "10.073.03": "High are thy feet when on thy way thou goest: the strength thou foundest here hath lent thee vigour. Thousand hyenas in thy mouth thou holdest. O Indra, mayst thou turn the Asvins hither.",

   "10.073.06": "Two of like name for him didst thou demolish, as Indra striking down the car of Usas. With thy beloved lofty Friends thou camest, and with the assurance of thine heart thou slewest.",
   "10.073.07": "War-loving Namuci thou smotest, robbing the Dasa of his magic for the Rsi. For man thou madest ready pleasant pathways, paths leading as it were directly God-ward.",
   "10.073.08": "These names of thine thou hast fulfilled completely: as Lord, thou boldest in thine arm, O Indra. In thee, through thy great might, the Gods are joyful: the roots of trees hast thou directed upward.",
   "10.073.09": "May the sweet Soma juices make him happy to cast his quoit that lies in depth of waters. Thou from the udder which o'er earth is fastened hast poured the milk into the kine and herbage.",
   "10.073.10": "When others call him offspring of the Courser, my meaning is that Mighty Power produced him. He came from Manyu and remained in houses: whence he hath sprung is known to Indra only.",

   "10.074.01": "I AM prepared to laud with song or worship the Noble Ones who are in earth and heaven, Or Coursers who have triumphed in, the contest, or those who famed, have won the prize with glory.",
   "10.074.02": "Their call, the call of Gods, went up to heaven: they kissed the ground with glory-seeking spirit, There where the Gods look on for happy fortune, and like the kindly heavens bestow their bounties.",

   "10.075.03": "His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth: he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light. Like floods of rain that fall- in thunder from the cloud, so Sindhu rushes on bellowing like a bull.",
   "10.075.04": "Like mothers to their calves, like milch kine with their milk, so, Sindhu, unto thee the roaring rivers run. Thou leadest as a warrior king thine army's wings what time thou comest in the van of these swift streams.",
   "10.075.05": "Favour ye this my laud, O Ganga, Yamuna, O Sutudri, Parusni and Sarasvati: With Asikni, Vitasta, O Marudvrdha, O Arjikiya with Susoma hear my call.",
   "10.075.06": "First with Trstama thou art eager to flow forth, with Rasa, and Susartu, and with Svetya here, With Kubha; and with these, Sindhu and Mehatnu, thou seekest in thy course Krumu and Gomati.",
   "10.075.07": "Flashing and whitely-gleaming in her mightiness, she moves along her ample volumes through the realms, Most active of the active, Sindhu unrestrained, like to a dappled mare, beautiful, fair to see.",
   "10.075.08": "Rich in good steeds is Sindhu, rich in cars and robes, rich in gold, nobly-fashioned, rich in ample wealth. Blest Silamavati and young Urnavati invest themselves with raiment rich in store of sweets.",
   "10.075.09": "Sindhu hath yoked her car, light-rolling, drawn by steeds, and with that car shall she win booty in this fight. So have I praised its power, mighty and unrestrained, of independent glory, roaring as it runs.",
   "10.076.01": "I GRASP at you when power and strength begin to dawn: bedew ye, Indra and the Maruts, Heaven and Earth, That Day and Night, in every hall of sacrifice, may wait on us and bless us when they first spring forth.",
   "10.076.02": "Press the libation out, most excellent of all: the Pressing-stone is grasped like a hand-guided steed. So let it win the valour that subdues the foe, and the fleet courser's might that speeds to ample wealth.",
   "10.076.03": "Juice that this Stone pours out removes defect of ours, as in old time it brought prosperity to man. At sacrifices they established holy rites on Tvastar's milk-blent juice bright with the hue of steeds.",
   "10.076.04": "Drive ye the treacherous demons far away from us: keep Nirrti afar and banish Penury. Pour riches forth for us with troops of hero sons, and bear ye up, O Stones, the song that visits Gods.",

   "10.076.06": "Stirred be the glorious Stones: let it press out the juice, the Stone with heavenly song that reaches up to heaven, There where the men draw forth the meath for which they long, sending their voice around in rivalry of speed.",
   "10.076.07": "The Stones press out the Soma, swift as car-borne men, and, eager for the spoil, drain forth the sap thereof To fill the beaker, they exhaust the udder's store, as the men purify oblations with their lips.",

   "10.077.07": "He who, engaged in the rite's final duty brings, as a man, oblation to the Maruts, Wins him life's wealthy fulness, blest with heroes: he shall be present, too, where Gods drink Soma.",

   "10.078.02": "Like fire with flashing flame, breast-bound with chains of gold, like tempest-blasts, self-moving, swift to lend your aid; As best of all foreknowers, excellent to guide, like Somas, good to guard the man who follows Law.",
   "10.078.03": "Shakers of all, like gales of wind they travel, like tongues of burning fires in their effulgence. Mighty are they as warriors clad in armour, and, like the Fathers' prayers, Most Bounteous Givers.",
   "10.078.04": "Like spokes of car-wheels in one nave united, ever victorious like heavenly Heroes, Shedding their precious balm like youthful suitors, they raise their voice and chant their psalm as singers.",

   "10.078.07": "Like rays of Dawn, the visitors of sacrifice, they shine with ornaments as eager to be bright. Like rivers hasting on, glittering with their spears, from far away they measure out the distances.",
   "10.078.08": "Gods, send us happiness and make us wealthy, letting us singers prosper, O ye Maruts. Bethink you of our praise and of our friendship: ye from of old have riches to vouchsafe us.",
   "10.079.01": "I HAVE beheld the might of this Great Being. Immortal in the midst of tribes of mortals. His jaws now open and now shut together: much they devour, insatiately chewing.",
   "10.079.02": "His eyes are turned away, his head is hidden: unsated with his tongue he eats the fuel. With hands upraised, with reverence in the houses, for him they quickly bring his food together.",
   "10.079.03": "Seeking, as 'twere, his Mother's secret bosom, he, like a child, creeps on through wide-spread bushes. One he finds glowing like hot food made ready, and kissing deep within the earth's recmes.",

   "10.079.05": "This man who quickly gives him food, who offers his gifts of oil and butter and supports him, - Him with his thousand eyes he closely looks on: thou showest him thy face from all sides, Agni.",
   "10.079.06": "Agni, hast thou committed sin or treason among the Gods? In ignorance I ask thee. Playing, not playing, he gold-hued and toothless, hath cut his food up as the knife a victim.",
   "10.079.07": "He born in wood hath yoked his horses rushing in all directions, held with reins that glitter. The well-born friend hath carved his food with Vasus: in all his limbs he hath increased and prospered.",
   "10.080.01": "AGNI bestows the fleet prize-winning courser: Agni, the hero famed and firm in duty. Agni pervades and decks the earth and heaven, and fills the fruitful dame who teems with heroes.",
   "10.080.02": "Blest be the wood that feeds the active Agni: within the two great worlds hath Agni entered. Agni impels a single man to battle, and with him rends in pieces many a foeman.",
   "10.080.03": "Agni rejoiced the car of him who praised lim, and from the waters burnt away jarutha. Agni saved Atri in the fiery cavem, and made Nrmedha rich with troops of children.",

   "10.081.04": "What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven? Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he established all things.",
   "10.081.05": "Nine highest, lowest, sacrificial natures, and these thy mid-most here, O Visvakarman, Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessed, and come thyself, exalted, to our worship.",
   "10.081.06": "Bring thou thyself, exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman, Earth and Heaven to worship. Let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and liberal patron.",
   "10.081.07": "Let us invoke to-day, to aid our labour, the Lord of Speech, the thought-swift Visvakarman. May he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid, whose works are righteous.",
   "10.082.01": "THE Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these worlds submerged in fatness. Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens and the earth were far extended.",
   "10.082.02": "Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer, and most lofty Presence. Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only One, beyond the Seven Rsis.",

   "10.082.05": "That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the Asuras and Gods had being,- What was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the Gods were seen together?",
   "10.082.06": "The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together. It rested set upon the Unborn's navel, that One wherein abide all things existing.",
   "10.082.07": "Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another thing hath risen up among you. Enwrapt in misty cloud, with lips that stammer, hymn-chanters wander and are discontented.",
   "10.083.01": "HE who hath reverenced thee, Manyu, destructive bolt, breeds for himself forthwith all conquering energy. Arya and Dasa will we conquer with thine aid, with thee the Conqueror, with conquest conquestsped.",

   "10.084.01": "BORNE on with thee, O Manyu girt by Maruts, let our brave men, impetuous, bursting forward, March on, like flames of fire in form, exulting, with pointed arrows, sharpening their weapons.",
   "10.084.02": "Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O Victor, as our army's leader. Slay thou our foes, distribute their possessions: show forth thy vigour, scatter those who hate us.",
   "10.084.03": "O Manyu, overcome thou our assailant on! breaking, slaying, crushing down the foemen. They have not hindered thine impetuous vigour: Mighty, Sole born! thou makest them thy subjects.",
   "10.084.04": "Alone or many thou art worshipped, Manyu: sharpen the spirit of each clan for battle. With thee to aid, O thou of perfect splendour, we will uplift the glorious shout for conquest.",

   "10.085.01": "TRUTH is the base that bears the earth; by Surya are the heavens sustained. By Law the Adityas stand secure, and Soma holds his place in heaven.",
   "10.085.02": "By Soma are the Adityas strong, by Soma mighty is the earth. Thus Soma in the midst of all these constellations hath his place.",
   "10.085.03": "One thinks, when they have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk the Soma's juice; Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma no one ever tastes.",

   "10.085.05": "When they begin to drink thee then, O God, thou swellest out again. Vayu is Soma's guardian God. The Moon is that which shapes the years.",
   "10.085.06": "Raibhi was her dear bridal friend, and Narasamsi led her home. Lovely was Surya's robe: she came to that which Gatha had adorned.",
   "10.085.07": "Thought was the pillow of her couch, sight was the unguent for her eyes: Her treasury was earth and heaven..when Surya went unto her Lord.",

   "10.085.18": "By their own power these Twain in close succession move; They go as playing children round the sacrifice. One of the Pair beholdeth all existing things; the other ordereth seasons and is born again.",
   "10.085.19": "He, born afresh, is new and new for ever ensign of days he goes before the Mornings Coming, he orders f6r the Gods their portion. The Moon prolongs the days of our existence.",
   "10.085.20": "Mount this, all-shaped, gold-hued, with strong wheels, fashioned of Kimsuka and Salmali, lightrolling, Bound for the world of life immortal, Surya: make for thy lord a happy bridal journey.",

   "10.085.23": "Straight in direction be the path:s, and thornless, whereon our fellows travel to the wooing. Let Aryaman and Bhaga lead us: perfect, O Gods, the union of the wife and husband.",
   "10.085.24": "Now from the noose of Varuna I free thee, wherewith Most Blessed Savitar hath bound thee. In Law's seat, to the world of virtuous action, I give thee up uninjured with thy consort.",

   "10.085.29": "Give thou the woollen robe away: deal treasure to the Brahman priests. This female fiend hath got her feet, and as a wife attends her lord.",
   "10.085.30": "Unlovely is his body when it glistens with this wicked fiend, What time the husband wraps about his limbs the garment of his wife.",
   "10.085.31": "Consumptions, from her people, which follow the bride's resplendent train,- These let the Holy Gods again bear to the place from which they came.",

   "10.087.12": "Lead thou the worshipper that eye, O Agni, wherewith thou lookest on the hoof-armed demon. With light celestial in Atharvan's manner burn up the foot who ruins truth with falsehood.",
   "10.087.13": "Agni, what curse the pair this day have uttered, what heated word the worshippers have spoken, Each arrowy taunt sped from the angry spirit,-pierce to the heart therewith the Yatudhanas.",

   "10.087.21": "From rear, from front, from under, from above us, O King, protect us as a Sage with wisdom. Guard to old age thy friend, O Friend, Eternal: O Agni, as Immortal, guard us mortals.",
   "10.087.22": "We set thee round us as a fort, victorious Agni, thee a Sage, Of hero lineage, day by day, destroyer of our treacherous foes.",

   "10.088.01": "DEAR, ageless sacrificial drink is offered in light-discovering, heaven-pervading Agni. The Gods spread forth through his Celestial Nature, that he might bear the world up and sustain it.",
   "10.088.02": "The world was swallowed and concealed in darkness: Agni was born, and light became apparent. The Deities, the broad earth, and the heavens, and plants, and waters gloried in his friendship.",
   "10.088.03": "Inspired by Gods who claim our adoration, I now will laud Eternal Lofty Agni, Him who hath spread abroad the earth with lustre, this heaven, and both the worlds, and air's midregion.",
   "10.088.04": "Earliest Priest whom all the Gods accepted, and chose him, and anointed him with butter, He swiftly made all things that fly, stand, travel, all that hath motion, Agni Jatavedas.",
   "10.088.05": "Because thou, Agni, Jatavedas, stoodest at the world's head with thy refulgent splendour, We sent thee forth with hymns and songs and praises: thou filledst heaven and earth, God meet for worship.",
   "10.088.06": "Head of the world is Agni in the night-time; then, as the Sun, at morn springs up and rises. Then to his task goes the prompt Priest foreknowing the wondrous power of Gods who must be honoured.",
   "10.088.07": "Lovely is he who, kindled in his greatness, hath shone forth, seated in the heavens, refulgent. With resonant hymns all Gods who guard our bodies have offered up oblation in this Agni.",
   "10.088.08": "First the Gods brought the hymnal into being; then they engendered Agni, then oblation. He was their satrifice that guards our bodies: him the heavens know, the earth, the waters know him.",
   "10.088.09": "He, Agni, whom the Gods have generated, in whom they offered up all worlds and creatures, He with his bright glow heated earth and heaven, urging himself right onward in his grandeur.",
   "10.088.10": "Then by the laud the Gods engendered Agni in heaven, who fills both worlds through strength and vigour. They made him to appear in threefold essence: he ripens plants of every form and nature.",
   "10.088.11": "What time the Gods, whose due is worship, set him as Surya, Son of Aditi, in heaven, When the Pair, ever wandering, sprang to being, all creatures that existed looked upon them.",
   "10.088.12": "For all the world of life the Gods made Agni Vaisvanara to be the days' bright Banner,- Him who hath spread abroad the radiant Mornings, and, coming with his light, unveils the darkness.",
   "10.088.13": "The wise and holy Deities engendered Agni Vaisvanara whom age ne'er touches. The Ancient Star that wanders on for ever, lofty and. strong, Lord of the Living Being.",
   "10.088.14": "We call upon the Sage with holy verses, Agni Vaisvanara the ever-beaming, Who hath surpassed both heaven and earth in greatness: lie is a God below, a God above us.",
   "10.088.15": "I have heard mention of two several pathways, ways of the Fathers and of Gods and mortals. On these two paths each moving creature travels, each thing between the Father and the Mother.",
   "10.088.16": "These two united paths bear him who journeys born from the head and pondered with the spirit He stands directed to all things existing, hasting, unresting in his fiery splendour.",
   "10.088.17": "Which of us twain knows where they speak together, upper and lower of the two rite-leaders? Our friends have helped to gather our assembly. They came to sacrifice; who will announce it?",
   "10.088.18": "How many are the Fires and Suns in number? What is the number of the Dawns and Waters? Not jestingly I speak to you, O Fathers. Sages, I ask you this for information.",
   "10.088.19": "As great as is the fair-winged Morning's presence to him who dwells beside us, matarisvan! Is what the Brahman does when he approaches to sacrifice and sits below the Hotar.",
   "10.089.01": "I WILL extol the most heroic Indra who with his might forced earth and sky asunder; Who hath filled all with width as man's Upholder, surpassing floods and rivers in his greatness.",
   "10.089.02": "Surya is he: throughout the wide expanses shall Indra turn him, swift as car-wheels, hither, Like a stream resting not but ever active he hath destroyed, with light, the blackhued darkness.",
   "10.089.03": "To him I sing a holy prayer, incessant new, matchless, common to the earth and heaven, Who marks, as they were backs, all living creatures: ne'er doth he fail a friend, the noble Indra.",
   "10.089.04": "I will send forth my songs in flow unceasing, like water from the ocean's depth, to Indra. Who to his car on both its sides securely hath fixed the earth and heaven as with an axle.",
   "10.089.05": "Rousing with draughts, the Shaker, rushing onward, impetuous, very strong, armed as with arrows Is Soma; forest trees and all the bushes deceive not Indra with their offered likeness.",
   "10.089.06": "Soma hath flowed to him whom naught can equal, the earth, the heavens, the firmament, the mountains,- When heightened in his ire his indignation shatters the firm and breaks the strong in pieces.",
   "10.089.07": "As an axe fells the tree so be slew Vrtra, brake down the strongholds and dug out the rivers. He cleft the mountain like a new-made pitcher. Indra brought forth the kine with his Companions.",
   "10.089.08": "Wise art thou, Punisher of guilt, O Indra. The sword lops limbs, thou smitest down the sinner, The men who injure, as it were a comrade, the lofty Law of Varuna and Mitra.",
   "10.089.09": "Men who lead evil lives, who break agreements, and injure Varuna, Aryaman and Mitra,- Against these foes, O Mighty Indra, sharpen, as furious death, thy Bull of fiery colour.",
   "10.089.10": "Indra is Sovran Lord of Earth and Heaven, Indra is Lord of waters and of mountains. Indra is Lord of prosperers and sages Indra must be invoked in rest and effort.",
   "10.089.11": "Vaster than days and nights, Giver of increase, vaster than firmament and flood of ocean, Vaster than bounds of earth and wind's extension, vaster than rivers and our lands is Indra.",
   "10.089.12": "Forward, as herald of refulgent Morning, let thine insatiate arrow fly, O Indra. And pierce, as 'twere a stone launched forth from heaven, with hottest blaze the men who love deception.",
   "10.089.13": "Him, verily, the moons, the mountains followed, the tall trees followed and the plants and herbage. Yearning with love both Worlds approached, the Waters waited on Indra when he first had being.",
   "10.089.14": "Where was the vengeful dart when thou, O Indra, clavest the demon ever beat on outrage? When fiends lay there upon the ground extended like cattle in the place of immolation?",
   "10.089.15": "Those who are set in enmity against us, the Oganas, O Indra, waxen mighty,- Let blinding darkness follow those our fbemen, while these shall have bright shining nights to light them.",
   "10.089.16": "May plentiful libations of the people, and singing Rsis' holy prayers rejoice thee. Hearing with love this common invocation, come unto us, pass by all those who praise thee.",
   "10.089.17": "O Indra, thus may we be made partakers of thy new favours that shall bring us profit. Singing with love, may we the Visvamitras win daylight even now through thee, O Indra.",
   "10.089.18": "Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best hero in the fight where spoil is gathered, The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vrtras, wins and gathers riches.",
   "10.090.01": "A THOUSAND heads hath Purusa, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.",
   "10.090.02": "This Purusa is all that yet hath been and all that is to be; The Lord of Immortality which waxes greater still by food.",
   "10.090.03": "So mighty is his greatness; yea, greater than this is Purusa. All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths eternal life in heaven.",
   "10.090.04": "With three-fourths Purusa went up: onefourth of him again was here. Thence he strode out to every side over what cats not and what cats.",
   "10.090.05": "From him Viraj was born; again Purusa from Viraj was born. As soon as he was born he spread eastward and westward o'er the earth.",
   "10.090.06": "When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Purusa as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.",
   "10.090.07": "They balmed as victim on the grass Purusa born in earliest time. With him the Deities and all Sadhyas and Rsis sacrificed.",
   "10.090.08": "From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up. He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame.",
   "10.090.09": "From that great general sacrifice Rcas and Sama-hymns were born: Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus had its birth from it.",
   "10.090.10": "From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth: From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born.",
   "10.090.11": "When they divided Purusa how many portions did they make? What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?",
   "10.090.12": "The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rajanya made. His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sudra was produced.",
   "10.090.13": "The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vayu from his breath.",
   "10.090.14": "Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.",
   "10.090.15": "Seven fencing-sticks had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were prepared, When the Gods, offering sacrifice, bound, as their victim, Purusa.",
   "10.090.16": "Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim these were the carliest holy ordinances. The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sidhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.",
   "10.091.01": "BRISK, at the place of Ila, hymned by men who wake, our own familiar Friend is kindled in the house; Hotar of all oblation, worthy of our choice, Lord, beaming, trusty friend to one who loveth him.",
   "10.091.02": "He, excellent in glory, guest in every house, finds like a swift-winged bird a home in every tree. Benevolent to men, he scorns no living man: Friend to the tribes of men he dwells with every tribe.",
   "10.091.03": "Most sage with insight, passing skilful with thy powers art thou, O Agni, wise with wisdom, knowing all. As Vasu, thou alone art Lord of all good things, of all the treasures that the heavens and earth produce.",
   "10.091.04": "Foreknowing well, O Agni, thou in Ila's place hast occupied thy regular station balmed with oil. Marked are thy comings like the comings of the Dawns, the rays of him who shineth spotless as the Sun.",
   "10.091.05": "Thy glories are, as lightnings from the rainy cloud, marked, many-hued, like heralds of the Dawns' approach, When, loosed to wander over plants and forest trees, thou crammest by thyself thy food into thy mouth.",
   "10.091.06": "Him, duly coming as their germ, have plants received: this Agni have maternal Waters brought to life. So in like manner do the forest trees and plants bear him within them and produce him evermore.",
   "10.091.07": "When, sped and urged by wind, thou spreadest thee abroad, swift piercing through thy food according to thy will, Thy never-ceasing blazes, longing to consume, like men on chariots, Agni, strive on every side.",
   "10.091.08": "Agni, the Hotar-priest who fills the assembly full, Waker of knowledge, chief Controller of the thought,- Him, yea, none other than thyself, doth man elect at sacrificial offerings great and small alike.",
   "10.091.09": "Here, Api, the arrangers, those attached to thee, elect thee as their Priest in sacred gatherings, When men with strewn clipt grass and sacrificial gifts offer thee entertainment, piously inclined.",
   "10.091.10": "Thine is the Herald's task and Cleanser's duly timed; Leader art thou, and Kindler for the pious man. Thou art Director, thou the ministering Priest: thou art the Brahman, Lord and Master in our home.",
   "10.091.11": "When mortal man presents to thee Immortal God, Agni, his fuel or his sacrificial gift, Then thou art his Adhvaryu, Hotar, messenger, callest the Gods and orderest the sacrifice.",
   "10.091.12": "From us these hymns in concert have gone forth to him, these. holy words, these Rcas, songs and eulogies, Eager for wealth, to Jatavedas fain for wealth: when they have waxen strong they please their Strengthener.",
   "10.091.13": "This newest eulogy will I speak forth to him, the Ancient One who loves it. May he hear our voice. May it come near his heart and make it stir with love, as a fond well-dressed matron clings about her lord.",
   "10.091.14": "He in whom horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are offered up,- To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth.",
   "10.091.15": "Into thy mouth is poured the offering, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle. Vouchsafe us wealth. strength-winning, blest with heroes, wealth lofty, praised by men, and full of splendour.",
   "10.092.01": "I PRAISE your Charioteer of sacrifice, the Lord of men, Priest of the tribes, refulgent, Guest of night. Blazing amid dry plants, snatching amid the green, the Strong, the Holy Herald hath attained to heaven.",
   "10.092.02": "Him, Agni, Gods and men have made their chief support, who drinks the fatness and completes the sacrifice. With kisses they caress the Grandson of the Red, like the swift ray of light, the Household Priest of Dawn.",
   "10.092.03": "Yea, we discriminate his and the niggard's ways: his branches evermore are sent forth to consume. When his terrific flames have reached the Immortal's world, then men remember and extol the Heavenly Folk.",
   "10.092.04": "For then the net of Law, Dyaus, and the wide expanse, Earth, Worship, and Devotion meet for highest praise, Varuna, Indra, Mitra were of one accord, and Savitar and Bhaga, Lords of holy might.",
   "10.092.05": "Onward, with ever-roaming Rudra, speed the floods: over Aramati the Mighty have they run. With them Parijman, moving round his vast domain, loud bellowing, bedews all things that are within.",
   "10.092.06": "Straightway the Rudras, Maruts visiting all men, Falcons of Dyaus, home-dwellers with the Asura,- Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman look on with these, and the swift-moving Indra with swift-moving Gods.",
   "10.092.07": "With Indra have they found enjoyment, they who toil, in the light's beauty, in the very Strong One's strength; The singers who in men's assemblies forged for him, according to his due, his friend the thunderbolt.",
   "10.092.08": "Even the Sun's Bay Coursers hath lie held in check: each one fears Indra as the mightiest of all. Unhindered, from the air's vault thunders day by day the loud triumphant breathing of the fearful Bull.",
   "10.092.09": "With humble adoration show this day your song of praise to mighty Rudra, Ruler of the brave: With whom, the Eager Ones, going their ordered course, he comes from heaven Self-bright, auspicious, strong to guard.",
   "10.092.10": "For these have spread abroad the fame of human kind, the Bull Brhaspati and Soma's brotherhood. Atharvan first by sacrifices made men sure: through skill the Bhrgus were esteemed of all as Gods.",
   "10.092.11": "For these, the Earth and Heaven with their abundant seed, four-bodied Narasmsa, Yama, Aditi, God Tvastar Wealth-bestower, the Rbhuksanas, Rodasi, Maruts, Visnu, claim and merit praise.",
   "10.092.12": "And may he too give car, the Sage, from far away, the Dragon of the Deep, to this our yearning call. Ye Sun and Moon who dwell in heaven and move in turn, and with your thought, O Earth and Sky, observe this well.",
   "10.092.13": "Dear to all Gods, may Pasan guard the ways we go, the Waters' child and Vayu help us to success. Sing lauds for your great bliss to Wind, the breath of all: ye Asvins prompt to hear, hear this upon your way.",
   "10.092.14": "With hymns of praise we sing him who is throned as Lord over these fearless tribes, the Selfresplendent One. We praise Night's youthful Lord benevolent to men, the foeless One, the free, with all celestial Dames.",
   "10.092.15": "By reason of his birth here Angiras first sang: the pressing-stones upraised bebeld the sacrifice- The stones through which the Sage became exceeding vast, and the sharp axe obtains in fight the beauteous place.",
   "10.093.01": "MIGHTY are ye, and far-extended, Heaven and Earth: both Worlds are evermore to us like two young Dames. Guard us thereby from stronger foe; guard us hereby to give us strength.",
   "10.093.02": "In each succeeding sacrifice that mortal honoureth the Gods, He who, most widely known and famed for happiness, invitetb them.",
   "10.093.03": "Ye who are Rulers over all, great is your sovran power as Gods. Ye all possess all majesty: all must be served in sacrifice.",
   "10.093.04": "These are the joyous Kings of Immortality, Parijman, Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuna. What else is Rudra, praised of men? the Maruts, Bhaga, Pusana?",
   "10.093.05": "Come also to our dwelling, Lords of ample wealth, common partakers of our waters, Sun and Moon, When the great Dragon of the Deep hath settled down upon their floors.",
   "10.093.06": "And let the Asvins, Lords of splendour, set us free,- both Gods, and, with their Laws, Mitra and Varuna. Through woes, as over desert lands, he speeds to ample opulence.",
   "10.093.07": "Yea, let the Asvins Twain he gracious unto us, even Rudras, and all Gods, Bhaga, Rathaspati; Parijman, Rbhu, Vaja, O Lords of all wealth Rbhuksanas.",
   "10.093.08": "Prompt is Rbhuksan, prompt the worshipper's strong drink: may thy fleet Bay Steeds, thine who sperdest on, approach. Not mans but God's is sacrifice whose psalm is unassailable.",
   "10.093.09": "O God Savitar, harmed by none, lauded, give us a place among wealthy princes. With his Car-steeds at once 'hath our Indra guided the reins and the car of these men.",
   "10.093.10": "To these men present here, O Heaven and Earth, to us grant lofty fame extending over all mankind. Give us a steed to win us strength, a steed with wealth for victory.",
   "10.093.11": "This speaker, Indra-for thou art our Friend-wherever he may be, guard thou, Victor! for help, ever for help Thy wisdom, Vasu! prosper him.",
   "10.093.12": "So have they strengthened this mine hymn which seems to take its bright path to the Sun, and reconciles the men: Thus forms a carpenter the yoke of horses, not to be displaced.",
   "10.093.13": "Whose chariot-seat hath come again laden with wealth and bright with gold, Lightly, with piercing ends, as 'twere two ranks of heroes ranged for fight.",
   "10.093.14": "This to Duhsima Prthavana have I sung, to Vena, Rama, to the nobles, and the King. They yoked five hundred, and their love of us was famed upon their way.",
   "10.093.15": "Besides, they showed us seven -and-seventy horses here. Tanva at once displayed his gift, Parthya at once displayed his gift; and straightway Mayava showed his.",
   "10.094.01": "LET these speak loudly forth; let us speak out aloud: to the loud speaking Pressing-stones address the speech; When, rich with Soma juice, Stones of the mountain, ye, united, swift to Indra bring the sound of praise.",
   "10.094.02": "They speak out like a hundred, like a thousand men: they cry aloud to us with their green-tinted mouths, While, pious Stones, they ply their task with piety, and, even before the Hotar, taste the offered food.",
   "10.094.03": "Loudly they speak, for they have found the savoury meath: they make a humming sound over the meat prepared. As they devour the branch of the Red-coloured Tree, these, the well-pastured Bulls, have uttered bellowings.",
   "10.094.04": "They cry aloud, with strong exhilarating drink, calling on Indra now, for they have found the meath. Bold, with the sisters they have danced, embraced by them, making the earth reecho with their ringing sound.",
   "10.094.05": "The Eagles have sent forth their cry aloft in heaven; in the sky's vault the dark impetuous ones have danced. Then downward to the nether stone's fixt place they sink, and, splendid as the Sun, effuse their copious stream.",
   "10.094.06": "Like strong ones drawing, they have put forth all their strength: the Bulls, harnessed together, bear the chariot-poles. When they have bellowed, panting, swallowing their food, the sound of their loud snorting is like that of steeds.",
   "10.094.07": "To these who have ten workers and a tenfold girth, to these who have ten yoke-straps and ten binding thongs, To these who bear ten reins, the eternal, sing ye praise, to these who bear ten car-poles, ten when they are yoked.",
   "10.094.08": "These Stones with ten conductors, rapid in their course, with lovely revolution travel round and round. They have been first to drink the flowing Soma juice, first to enjoy the milky fluid of the stalk.",
   "10.094.09": "These Soma-eaters kiss Indra's Bay-coloured Steeds: draining. the stalk they sit upon the ox's hide. Indra, when he hath drunk Soma-nicath drawn by them, waxes in strength, is famed, is mighty as a Bull.",
   "10.094.10": "Strong is your stalk; ye, verily, never shall be harmed; ye have refreshment, ye are ever satisfied. Fair are ye, as it were, through splendour of his wealth, his in whose sacrifice, O Stones, ye find delight.",
   "10.094.11": "Bored deep, but not pierced through with holes, are ye, O Stones, not loosened, never weary, and exempt from death, Eternal, undiseased, moving in sundry ways, unthirsting, full of fatness, void of all desire.",
   "10.094.12": "Your fathers, verily, stand firm from age to age: they, loving rest, are not dissevered from their seat. Untouched by time, ne'er lacking green plants and green trees, they with their voice have caused the heavens and earth to hear.",
   "10.094.13": "This, this the Stones proclaim, what time they are disjoined, and when with ringing sounds they move and drink the balm. Like tillers of the ground when they are sowing seed, they mix the Soma, nor, devouring, minish it.",
   "10.094.14": "They have raised high their voice for juice, for sacrifice, striking the Mother earth as though they danced thereon. So loose thou too his thought who hath effused the sap, and let the Stones which we are honouring be disjoined.",
   "10.095.01": "Ho there, my consort! Stay, thou fierce-souled lady, and let us reason for a while together. Such thoughts as these of ours, while yet unspoken in days gone by have never brought us comfort.",
   "10.095.02": "What am I now to do with this thy saying? I have gone from thee like the first of Mornings. Pururavas, return thou to thy dwelling: I, like the wind, am difficult to capture.",
   "10.095.03": "Like a shaft sent for glory from the quiver, or swift-steed winning cattle winning hundreds. The lightning seemed to flash, as cowards planned it. The minstrels bleated like a lamb in trouble.",
   "10.095.04": "Giving her husband's father life and riches, from the near dwelling, when her lover craved her, She sought the home wherein she found her pleasure, accepting day and night her lord's embraces.",
   "10.095.05": "Thrice in the day didst thou embrace thy consort, though coldly she received thy fond caresses. To thy desires, Pururavas, I yielded: so wast thou king, O hero, of my body.",
   "10.095.06": "The maids Sujirni, Sreni, Sumne-api, Charanyu, Granthini, and Hradecaksus,- These like red kine have hastened forth, the bright ones, and like milch-cows have lowed in emulation.",
   "10.095.07": "While he was born the Dames sate down together, the Rivers with free kindness gave him nurture; And then, Pururavas, the Gods increased thee for mighty battle, to destroy the Dasyus.",
   "10.095.08": "When I, a mortal, wooed to mine embraces these heavenly nymphs who laid aside their raiment, Like a scared snake they fled from me in terror, like chariot horses when the car has touched them.",
   "10.095.09": "When, loving these Immortal Ones, the mortal hath converse with the nymphs as they allow him. Like swans they show the beauty of their bodies, like horses in their play they bite and nibble.",
   "10.095.10": "She who flashed brilliant as the falling lightning brought me delicious presents from the waters. Now from the flood be born a strong young hero May Uruvasi prolong her life for ever",
   "10.095.11": "Thy birth hath made me drink from earthly milch-kine: this power, Pururavas, hast thou vouchsafed me. I knew, and, warned thee, on that day. Thou wouldst not hear me. What sayest thou, when naught avails thee?",
   "10.095.12": "When will the son be born and seek his father? Mourner-like, will he weep when first he knows him? Who shall divide the accordant wife and husband, while fire is shining with thy consort's parents?",
   "10.095.13": "I will console him when his tears are falling: he shall not weep and cry for care that blesses. That which is thine, between us, will I send thee. Go home again, thou fool;.thou hast not won me.",
   "10.095.14": "Thy lover shall flee forth this day for ever, to seek, without return, the farthest distance. Then let his bed be in Destruction's bosom, and there let fierce rapacious wolves devour him.",
   "10.095.15": "Nay, do not die, Pururavas, nor vanish: let not the evil-omened wolves devour thee. With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women.",
   "10.095.16": "When amid men in altered shape I sojourned, and through four autumns spent the nights among them, I tasted once a day a drop of butter; and even now with that am I am contented.",
   "10.095.17": "I, her best love, call Urvasi to meet me, her who fills air and measures out the region. Let the gift brought by piety approach thee. Turn thou to me again: my heart is troubled.",
   "10.095.18": "Thus speak these Gods to thee, O son of Ila: As death hath verily got thee for his subject, Thy sons shall serve the Gods with their oblation, and thou, moreover, shalt rejoice in Svarga.",
   "10.096.01": "In the great synod will I laud thy two Bay Steeds: I prize the sweet strong drink of thee the Warrior- God, His who pours lovely oil as 'twere with yellow drops. Let my songs enter thee whose form hath golden tints.",
   "10.096.02": "Ye who in concert sing unto the goldhued place, like Bay Steeds driving onward to the heavenly seat, For Indra laud ye strength allied with Tawny Steeds, laud him whom cows content as 'twere with yellow drops.",
   "10.096.03": "His is that thunderbolt, of iron, goldenhued, gold-coloured, very dear, and yellow in his arms; Bright with strong teeth, destroying with its tawny rage. In Indra are set fast all forms of golden hue.",
   "10.096.04": "As if a lovely ray were laid upon the sky, the golden thunderbolt spread out as in a race. That iron bolt with yellow jaw smote Ahi down. A thousand flames had he who bore the tawny-hued.",
   "10.096.05": "Thou, thou, when praised by men who sacrificed of old. hadst pleasure in their lauds, O Indra golden-haired. All that befits thy song of praise thou welcornest, the perfect pleasant gift, O Golden-hued from birth.",
   "10.096.06": "These two dear Bays bring hither Indra on his car, Thunder-armed, joyous, meet for laud, to drink his fill. Many libations flow for him who loveth them: to Indra have the gold-hued Soma juices run.",
   "10.096.07": "Tle gold-hued drops have flowed to gratify his wish: the yellow dro s have urged the swift Bays to the Strong. He who speeds on with Bay Steeds even as he lists hath satisfied his longing for the golden drops.",
   "10.096.08": "At the swift draught the Soma-drinker waxed in might, the Iron One with yellow beard and yellow hair. He, Lord of Tawny Coursers, Lord of fleet-foot Mares, will bear his Bay Steeds safely over all distress.",
   "10.096.09": "His yellow-coloured jaws, like ladles move apart, what time, for strength, he makes the yellowtinted stir, When, while the bowl stands there, he grooms his Tawny Steeds, when he hath drunk strong drink, the sweet juice that he loves.",
   "10.096.10": "Yea, to the Dear One's seat in homes of heaven and earth the Bay Steeds' Lord hath whinnied like a horse for food. Then the great wish hath seized upon him mightily, and the Beloved One hath gained high power of life,",
   "10.096.11": "Thou, comprehending with thy might the earth and heaven, acceptest the dear hymn for ever new and new. O Asura, disclose thou and make visible the Cow's beloved home to the bright golden Sun.",
   "10.096.12": "O Indra, let the eager wishes of the folk bring thee, delightful, golden-visored, on thy car, That, pleased with sacrifice wherein ten fingers toil, thou mayest, at the feast, drink of our offered meath.",
   "10.096.13": "Juices aforetime, Lord of Bays, thou drankest; and thine especially is this libation. Gladden thee, Indra, with the meath-rich Soma: pour it down ever, Mighty One! within thee.",
   "10.097.01": "HERBS that sprang up in time of old, three ages earlier than the Gods,- Of these, whose hue is brown, will I declare the hundred powers and seven.",
   "10.097.02": "Ye, Mothers, have a hundred homes, yea, and a thousand are your growths. Do ye who have a thousand powers free this my patient from disease.",
   "10.097.03": "Be glad and joyful in the Plants, both blossoming and bearing fruit, Plants that will lead us to success like mares who conquer in the race.",
   "10.097.04": "Plants, by this name I speak to you, Mothers, to you the Goddesses: Steed, cow, and garment may I win, win back thy very self, O man.",
   "10.097.05": "The Holy Fig tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna tree: Winners of cattle shali ye be if ye regain for me this man.",
   "10.097.06": "He who hath store of Herbs at hand like Kings amid a crowd of men,- Physician is that sage's name, fiend-slayer, chaser of disease.",
   "10.097.07": "Herbs rich in Soma, rich in steeds, in nourishments, in strengthening power,- All these have I provided here, that this man may be whole again.",
   "10.097.08": "The healing virtues of the Plants stream forth like cattle from the stall,- Plants that shall win me store of wealth, and save thy vital breath, O man.",
   "10.097.09": "Reliever is your mother's name, and hence Restorers are ye called. Rivers are ye with wings that fly: keep far whatever brings disease.",
   "10.097.10": "Over all fences have they passed, as steals a thief into the fold. The Plants have driven from the frame whatever malady was there.",
   "10.097.11": "When, bringing back the vanished strength, I hold these herbs within my hand, The spirit of disease departs ere he can seize upon the life.",
   "10.097.12": "He through whose frame, O Plants, ye creep member by member, joint by joint,- From him ye drive away disease like some strong arbiter of strife.",
   "10.097.13": "Fly, Spirit of Disease, begone, with the blue jay and kingfisher. Fly with the wind's impetuousspeed, vanish together with the storm.",
   "10.097.14": "Help every one the other, lend assistance each of you to each, All of you be accordant, give furtherance to this speech of mine.",
   "10.097.15": "Let fruitful Plants, and fruitless, those that blossom, and the blossomless, Urged onward by Brhaspati, release us from our pain and grief;",
   "10.097.16": "Release me from the curse's plague and woe that comes from Varuna; Free me from Yama's fetter, from sin and offence against the Gods.",
   "10.097.17": "What time, descending from the sky, the Plants flew earthward, thus they spake: No evil shall befall the man whom while he liveth we pervade,",
   "10.097.18": "Of all the many Plants whose King is, Soma, Plants of hundred forms, Thou art the Plant most excellent, prompt to the wish, sweet to the heart.",
   "10.097.19": "O all ye various Herbs whose King is Soma, that o'erspread the earth, Urged onward by Brhaspati, combine your virtue in this Plant.",
   "10.097.20": "Unharmed be he who digs you up, unharmed the man for whom I dig: And let no malady attack biped or quadruped of ours.",
   "10.097.21": "All Plants that hear this speech, and those that have departed far away, Come all assembled and confer your healing power upon this Herb.",
   "10.097.22": "With Soma as their Sovran Lord the Plants hold colloquy and say: O King, we save from death the man whose cure a Brahman undertakes.",
   "10.097.23": "Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant thy vassals are the trees. Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to injure us.",
   "10.098.01": "COME, be thou Mitra, Varuna, or Pusan, come, O Brhaspati, to mine oblation: With Maruts, Vasus, or Adityas, make thou Parjanya pour for Santanu his rain-drops.",
   "10.098.02": "The God, intelligent, the speedy envoy whom thou hast sent hath come to me, Devapi: Address thyself to me and turn thee hither within thy lips will I put brilliant language.",
   "10.098.03": "Within my mouth, Brhaspati, deposit speech lucid, vigorous, and free from weakness, Thereby to win for Santanu the rain-fall. The meath-rich drop from heaven hath passed within it.",
   "10.098.04": "Let the sweet drops descend on us, O Indra: give us enough to lade a thousand wagons. Sit to thy Hotar task; pay worship duly, and serve the Gods, Devapi, with oblation.",
   "10.098.05": "Knowing the God's good-will, Devapi, Rsi, the son of Rstisena, sate as Hotar. He hath brought down from heaven's most lofty summit the ocean of the rain, celestial waters.",
   "10.098.06": "Gathered together in that highest ocean, the waters stood by deities obstructed. They burried down set free by Arstisena, in gaping clefts, urged onward by Devapi.",
   "10.098.07": "When as chief priest for Santanu, Devapi, chosen for Hotar's duty, prayed beseeching, Graciously pleased Brhaspati vouchsafed him a voice that reached the Gods and won the waters.",
   "10.098.08": "O Agni whom Devapi Arstisena, the mortal man, hath kindled in his glory, Joying in him with all the Gods together, urge on the sender of the rain, Parjanya.",

   "10.099.11": "Through lauds of him hath Ausija Rjisvan burst, with the Mighty's aid, the stall of Pipru. When the saint pressed the juice and shone as singer, he seized the forts and with his craft subdued them.",
   "10.099.12": "So, swiftly Asura, for exaltation, hath the great Vamraka come nigh to Indra. He will, when supplicated, bring him blessing: he hath brought all, food, strength, a happy dwelling.",
   "10.100.01": "Be, like thyself, O Indra, strong for our delight: here lauded, aid us, Maghavan, drinker of the juice. Savitar with the Gods protect us: hear ye Twain. We ask for freedom and complete felicity.",

   "10.102.06": "In hope of victory that bull was harnessed: Kesi the driver urged him on with shouting. As he ran swiftly with the car behind him his lifted heels pressed close on Mudgalani.",
   "10.102.07": "Deftly for him he stretched the car-pole forward, guided the bull thereto and firmly yoked him. Indra vouchsafed the lord of cows his favour: with mighty steps the buffalo ran onward.",
